        "name": "Accursed",
        "description": "A drow enters a tavern, hitting his head on the door frame and tripping on a chair leg. As he rises back to his feet, a brawl begins amongst a couple other patrons. With a look, a sigh, and flick of his wrist, the brawlers both slip on an errant puddle of grog, hit their heads on tabletops, and fall unconscious. Finally arriving at the bar, the drow can enjoy his drinks. An elf argues with herself as she engages an orc raiding party in combat. Recalcitrantly, a spirit exits the elf’s body, a thin cord of Ethereal energy connecting the two, and fights alongside her, unleashing a terrible scream that causes the bandits all to drop dead of fright. Wielding a terrible blade, a human engages the palace guards, slicing her adversaries in twain as if they were cloth. An archer comes around the corner, and she throws her sword, impaling the guard before he can even nock an arrow. As the vile weapon reappears in her outstretched hand, she saunters into the throne room, staring at the quivering king with death in her eyes. At last, the crown is hers. Accurseds are afflicted with a permanent magic that is inconvenient at best and debilitating at worst. But magic is still magic, and accurseds have found a way to harness the power of their curse to their own ends, while managing some of the worst symptoms of their condition. Either way, their curse is now theirs to use however they see fit. Unending Affliction Most curses used by mortals — such as the hex and bestow curse spells — are temporary, a simple inconvenience until the magic expires. For each accursed, though, the affliction is permanent, a powerful magic that never fades. These curses can be received through many means: gaining the ire of a deity, a large coven of hags, or a powerful extraplanar entity; inheriting it by being born into a cursed family line; touching a cursed object; being hit by a volatile spell that was incorrectly cast; or receiving the curse from the bite or scratch of another cursed creature, among a slew of other possibilities. Curse’s Conqueror The vast majority of people who receive a permanent curse consign themselves to their fate, either finding a way to live with their curse’s adverse effects or giving themselves fully to the curse’s compulsions. A creature becomes an accursed by following a different path. Accurseds are rare, not due to lack of people becoming cursed, but because those who suffer these curses often lack the conviction to resist them. An accursed dedicates their time and willpower to find a way to make the magic of their curse work for them, though each in their own way. Some accurseds experiment in a lab or scour the world for forgotten lore, trying to find a ritual or alchemical concoction. Others turn to nature or faith, using prayer, meditation, or mindfulness to synthesize the curse’s magic into their own being. And others still use sheer stubbornness to bend the curse to their will. Regardless of method, an accursed is one who has conquered their curse, drawing on its magic while managing its lingering side effects. Creating an Accursed When creating an accursed, the most important aspect to consider is your curse itself. What is your curse’s nature, and how did you receive it? As a starting character, you’ll choose the nature of your curse, but exactly how you received it is up to you. Did you or one of your ancestors anger a god or other powerful entity? Was the curse transferred to you by another afflicted individual? Or did some magic ritual go awry with you in proximity? Another important aspect of creating an accursed is how you came to be in control of your curse’s power. Did you study and experiment? Did you harmonize with it? Or did you stubbornly refuse to let it control you? What do you plan to do with this power you’ve attained? A curse is a magic of vile energies created to inflict suffering. Do you use this magic for its intended purpose, conquering and slaying for your own gain? Or do you resist the magic’s nature and use it to become a champion of the downtrodden, a hero who can empathize with great suffering? It’s your power now, so only you can decide what to do with it. Quick Build You can make an accursed quickly by following these suggestions. Your highest score depends greatly on the Conquered Curse you choose: make Strength your highest ability score for a Conquered Curse that relies on melee or thrown weapons, Dexterity your highest ability score for one that relies on finesse or ranged weapons, or your choice of curse ability — Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma — for one that relies on the use of the curse’s magical effects. If Strength or Dexterity is your highest ability score, your next-highest should be your choice of curse ability, followed by Constitution; for the more magically oriented Conquered Curses, make your next-highest ability score Constitution, followed by Dexterity. Then, choose the folk hero background. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d10 per accursed level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per accursed level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows Tools: None Saving Throws: Wisdom, and your choice of Intelligence or Charisma Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, and Survival Starting Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: ( a ) scale mail or ( b ) leather armor ( a ) a hand crossbow and 20 bolts or ( b ) a martial weapon of your choice (if proficient) ( a ) an arcane focus, ( b ) a druidic focus, or ( c ) a holy symbol ( a ) an explorer’s pack, ( b ) a priest’s pack, or ( c ) a scholar’s pack Any two simple weapons Multiclassing and the Accursed If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook , here’s what you need to know if you choose accursed as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of at least 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an accursed. Proficiencies Gained. If accursed isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an accursed: light armor, medium armor, simple weapons. Spell Slots. Add half your levels in the accursed class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.

Conquered Curse Through unfortunate circumstances, you were stricken with a curse that should have broken you. However, whether by sheer willpower, introspective meditation, or arcane study, you not only overcame the worst of the challenges your curse presented, but learned to harness its power. Choose the curse you conquered: Curse of Animation, Curse of the Armament, Curse of Combustion, Curse of the Created, Curse of Immortality, Curse of Misfortune, Curse of Mummification, Curse of Petrification, or Curse of Somnolence. All conquered curses are detailed at the end of the class. Your curse has become an integral part of you. The remove curse spell, as well as any similar effect, has no effect on your curse when it is cast on you. If your curse takes the form of a magical disease, you can’t be cured of it by any means. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 11th, 15th, and 20th level, as well as a list of curse spells (detailed in the Spellcasting class feature). Ailments Each curse has ailments caused by its lingering effects. They are inconvenient, and occasionally dangerous, detriments to which you are always subject, and are referred to by features you gain later in this class. Curse Ability & Curse Save DC Some of your accursed features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. Due to the varying ways that an accursed can overcome their affliction, not all utilize the same ability score to control it. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your curse ability. You should choose Intelligence if you scoured the multiverse for secrets that allow you to manage your curse using rituals or minor magical practices, Wisdom if you used introspective meditation techniques to harmonize with your curse and make it a part of you, or Charisma if you conquered your curse through sheer force of will or by bargaining with it. Depending on the curse ability you chose, the saving throw DC of your accursed features is calculated as follows: Curse save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your curse ability modifier Jinx As an action, you can attempt to bestow a minor curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become subject to your choice of one of the following jinxes until the end of your next turn: The target has disadvantage on the next ability check it makes. The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against a creature of your choice that you can see. If a creature can see you when you use this feature, it knows that you are the source of the jinx. Until the target makes the type of roll associated with the jinx, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain the effect, extending the jinx’s duration until the end of your next turn. However, the jinx ends once the target makes the associated type of roll, if you are more than 90 feet from the target, or if any of the dispel magic , greater restoration , or remove curse spells is cast on the target. Malediction Metamorphosis Starting at 2nd level, your curse begins evolving within you, changed by your manipulation of its purpose. You can guide this mutation to compliment your capabilities, or open new avenues of power for yourself. You gain one malediction metamorphosis of your choice. Your metamorphosis options are listed at the end of the class’s description. When you reach certain accursed levels, you gain additional metamorphoses of your choice, as shown in the Malediction Metamorphoses column of the Accursed table. Spellcasting At 2nd level, you learn to use your curse’s vile magicks to fuel the casting of spells. See Chapter 10 in the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting. Spell Slots The Accursed table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. Curse Spells Each Conquered Curse has a list of spells — its curse spells — that you learn when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the curse description. These spells are added to the accursed spell list for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Accursed table. You ignore the material component requirement of a curse spell if it has one. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know the curse spell you gain at 2nd level from your Conquered Curse, and one 1st-level spell of your choice from the accursed spell list, for a total of two spells known. The Spells Known column of the Accursed table shows when you learn more spells of your choice from the accursed spell list. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, when you reach 5th level in this class, you learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level, in addition to the curse spell you gain at 5th level from your Conquered Curse. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the accursed spells you know — which can be one of your curse spells — and replace it with another spell from the accursed spell list, which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Your curse ability is your spellcasting ability for your accursed spells, since your ability to cast spells comes from the control you have over your curse’s power. You use your curse ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your curse ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an accursed spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your curse ability modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your curse ability modifier Spellcasting Focus When you gain this feature, choose arcane foci, druidic foci, or holy symbols, depending on how you discovered to channel your curse. You can use the chosen type of implement or a cursed object as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook ) for your accursed spells. Accursed Spell List Here’s the list of spells you consult when you learn an accursed spell. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. Many of these spells are from the Player’s Handbook . If a spell’s name is followed by the XGE superscript, the spell can be found in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything . Additionally, spells with the UAH superscript are original spells that can be found in Chapter 4: Feats & Spells . 1st Level Bane (enchantment) Cause fear XGE (necromancy) Clumsiness infusion UAH (transmutation) Curse shock UAH (necromancy) Detect evil and good (divination) Detect magic (divination, ritual) Drain UAH (necromancy) Evil eye UAH (necromancy) Hatred infusion UAH (enchantment) Hex (enchantment) Inflict wounds (necromancy) Terror infusion UAH (necromancy) 2nd Level Blindness/deafness (necromancy) Corrode metal UAH (transmutation) Darkness (evocation) Hex bolt UAH (necromancy) Hold person (enchantment) Knock (transmutation) Ray of enfeeblement (necromancy) Shadow blade XGE (illusion) Sorrow infusion UAH (enchantment) Throat rend UAH (necromancy) Wave of agony UAH (necromancy) 3rd Level Bestow curse (necromancy) Bloodlust infusion UAH (enchantment) Counterspell (abjuration) Dispel magic (abjuration) Hex storm UAH (necromancy) Enemies abound XGE (enchantment) Fear (illusion) Nondetection (abjuration) Remove curse (abjuration) Scourge’s mantle UAH (necromancy) Shadow bow UAH (illusion) Vampiric touch (necromancy) 4th Level Blight (necromancy) Confusion (enchantment) Curse ward UAH (abjuration, ritual) Death burst UAH (necromancy) Elemental bane XGE (transmutation) Polymorph (transmutation) Shadow of moil XGE (necromancy) Sickening radiance XGE (evocation) Susceptibility infusion UAH (transmutation) 5th Level Antilife shell (abjuration) Apathy infusion UAH (enchantment) Bestow malediction UAH (necromancy) Dispel caster UAH (necromancy) Enervation XGE (necromancy) Hex infusion UAH (necromancy) Hold monster (enchantment) Stolen life UAH (necromancy) Ailment Control Starting at 2nd level, you can also use your spell slots to exert control over your curse’s ailments, either afflicting another creature with one of your ailments or suppressing your ailments’ effects on yourself. The duration of the effect depends on the level of the spell slot expended to use it: 1 minute for a 1st-level spell slot, 10 minutes for a 2nd-level, 1 hour for a 3rd-level, 8 hours for a 4th-level, or 24 hours for a spell slot of 5th-level or higher. Afflict. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to attempt to afflict a creature within 30 feet that you can see with your choice of one of your curse’s ailments. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer the chosen ailment for the duration. At the end of each of an afflicted creature’s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending its affliction on a successful save. A dispel magic , greater restoration , or remove curse spell cast on the target also ends its affliction. Suppress. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot and choose any number of your curse’s ailments. You ignore the effects of the chosen ailments for the duration. Jealous Blight At 3rd level, your curse begins possessively guarding you from others of its ilk, refusing to share its host. When you touch or attune to a cursed object other than your curse, it doesn’t stop being cursed, but the object’s curse doesn’t affect you. Once you reach 7th level in this class, your curse protects you from a wider range of effects. You are immune to curse effects other than your curse, such as the hex and bestow curse spells, and your hit point maximum and ability scores can’t be reduced against your will. Once you reach 14th level in this class, a magical effect other than your curse can’t age you, possess you, put you to sleep, or transform you against your will. Once you reach 20th level in this class, a magical effect other than your curse can’t impose disadvantage on any roll you make. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Malediction Versatility Starting at 4th level, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one of your metamorphoses with a different metamorphosis for which you qualify. If you’re 12th level or higher and replacing a metamorphosis causes you to no longer meet another metamorphosis’ prerequisites, you must replace that metamorphosis as well. For example, if you choose to replace your Arcane Anathema metamorphosis with Enshrouding Imprecation, you must also replace the Capacious Anathema metamorphosis if you have it because you would no longer meet its prerequisites. Since you chose Enshrouding Imprecation, you can replace Capacious Anathema with any other metamorphosis that doesn’t have a prerequisite, or with the Muffling Imprecation or Sleighting Imprecation metamorphosis because you now meet its prerequisites. You can’t use this feature to choose a metamorphosis with an 18th level prerequisite, unless the metamorphosis you are replacing has that prerequisite. Malediction Metamorphoses If a malediction metamorphosis has prerequisites, you must meet them to choose it. You can choose the metamorphosis at the same time you meet its prerequisites. The metamorphoses are presented in groups by level prerequisite (2nd, 10th, and 18th), and alphabetically within those groups. If you’re having difficulty picturing how metamorphoses connect to higher-level metamorphoses that have prerequisites, see the Malediction Metamorphosis Trees diagram at the end of the metamorphosis descriptions. Arcane Anathema Your curse is disruptive to other forms of magic. As an action, you can touch a creature and attempt to free it from a spell’s effects. Make a curse ability check against a DC equal to 10 + twice the spell’s level. On a success, you end the effects of the spell on the target. This has no effect on any of the spell’s other targets. Bolstering Suppression Your curse protects you when you give it a nudge. When you use your Suppress, you gain temporary hit points equal to your accursed level + your curse ability modifier. You lose any remaining temporary hit points from this ability when the Suppress ends. Enshrouding Imprecation Your curse’s magicks coat you like a shadowy cloak. You can Hide as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, while you’re in dim light or darkness, you can attempt to hide even from a creature that can see you. Fecund Affliction Your curse gleefully spreads its effects to other victims. Once, you can use your Afflict without expending a spell slot. Its duration is 1 minute. You regain the use of this ability when you finish a short or long rest. Hex Armor When you’re in danger, the magicks of your curse manifest around you like a suit of armor. Your AC can’t be less than 13 + your curse ability modifier, regardless of what kind of armor you’re wearing. Hostile Bane Your curse imbues your attacks with its dark magicks. Once during each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack, you can cause the attack to deal additional necrotic damage equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum 1). Scourge Speech Whenever you speak, you can imbue your voice with the power and vile nature of your curse, causing it to boom up to three times as loud as normal. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can gain a bonus to the check equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum +1). When you use either of these abilities, your voice gains an unsettling supernatural quality. Swift Jinx Your curse excitedly responds to being used for jinxes. You can use your Jinx as a bonus action. When you do, you can’t use your action to maintain the jinx on your subsequent turns, even if the creature hasn’t made the associated type of roll. Capacious Anathema Prerequisite : 10th level, Arcane Anathema When you use your Arcane Anathema and succeed on the ability check, you can choose up to five other creatures within 30 feet of the target that you can see that are also affected by the spell. You end the spell’s effects on each of the chosen creatures. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Eldritch Bane Prerequisite : 10th Level, Hostile Bane Once during each of your turns when you roll damage for an accursed class feature or accursed spell that doesn’t include an attack, you can add your curse ability modifier (minimum 1) to the damage roll. Enervating Jinx Prerequisite : 10th Level, Swift Jinx The following jinxes are added to the list of options you can choose when a creature fails its Wisdom saving throw against your Jinx feature: When the target makes its next damage roll for a spell, it rolls the damage dice twice and uses the lower result. When the target makes its next damage roll for a weapon, it rolls the damage dice twice and uses the lower result. You can use these jinx options a total number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain your expended uses when you finish a long rest. Hex Aura Prerequisite : 10th level, Hex Armor When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you causes you to take damage, you can use your reaction to cast hex on that creature, without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this ability, it ends early if the target drops to 0 hit points. Hex Plate Prerequisite : 10th level, Hex Armor Your AC can’t be less than 16 + your curse ability modifier, regardless of what kind of armor you’re wearing. Infectious Affliction Prerequisite : 10th level, Fecund Affliction When your affliction ends on a creature before its full duration has elapsed, you can use your reaction to attempt to afflict a different creature you can see within 30 feet of the previously afflicted creature. The new target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become the sufferer of the affliction for its remaining duration. Instinctual Suppression Prerequisite : 10th level, Bolstering Suppression When you roll initiative, you can use your reaction to use your Suppress. If you do, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC until the end of your next turn. You can take this reaction even if you are surprised. Martial Bane Prerequisite : 10th level, Hostile Bane You lose the benefits of your Hostile Bane. Instead, each time you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can cause the attack to deal additional necrotic damage equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum 1). Muffling Imprecation Prerequisite : 10th level, Enshrouding Imprecation While you’re in dim light or darkness, you can ignore the verbal components of your accursed spells and you gain a bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum +1). Obstinate Anathema Prerequisite : 10th level, Arcane Anathema When you are incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, or stunned by a spell’s effects, you are still able to use your action, provided that you aren’t unconscious and the only action you take is to use your Arcane Anathema. Prolific Affliction Prerequisite : 10th level, Fecund Affliction When you spend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to use your Afflict, instead of increasing the affliction’s duration, you can choose an additional target for each slot level above 1st. If you do, each target that fails its saving throw is afflicted for 1 minute. Resistant Suppression Prerequisite : 10th level, Bolstering Suppression When you use your Suppress, you gain resistance to any damage type of your choice. You lose this resistance when the Suppress ends or you use your Suppress again. Scourge Sense Prerequisite: 10th Level, Scourge Speech You can cast the detect evil and good and detect magic spells at will, without expending a spell slot. While you concentrate on either spell, you are also aware if any creature or object within 30 feet of you is cursed, and can use your action on your turn to learn the properties of a curse affecting one such creature or object. Scourge Visage Prerequisite : 10th Level, Scourge Speech As an action, you can cause the magicks of your curse to manifest around you as a horrifying visage. The visage intangibly coats your entire body and anything you’re wearing or carrying, and can look like a cloak, a suit of armor, or another type of inanimate covering that obscures your features. While you’re cloaked in the visage, ability checks made to ascertain your emotional state or whether you’re lying automatically fail, and whenever an enemy within 5 feet of you that can see you makes a saving throw against being frightened, it subtracts your curse ability modifier (minimum 1) from the roll. The visage remains until you become incapacitated or you choose to dismiss it (no action required). Sleighting Imprecation Prerequisite : 10th Level, Enshrouding Imprecation While you’re in dim light or darkness, you can ignore the somatic components of your accursed spells, you gain a bonus to Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) and Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) checks equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum +1) , and you can magically form the magicks of your curse into a set of thieves’ tools whenever you would make an ability check using thieves’ tools. Startling Jinx Prerequisite : 10th level, Swift Jinx The following jinxes are added to the list of options you can choose when a creature fails its Wisdom saving throw against your Jinx feature: The target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against being frightened. The target has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it makes to maintain its concentration. Adaptive Malediction Prerequisite : 18th level When you finish a short rest, you can choose to replace one of your other metamorphoses with a different metamorphosis, and when you finish a long rest, you can choose to replace any number of your other metamorphoses with different metamorphoses. To choose a replacement metamorphosis, you must meet its prerequisites, and it can’t have an 18th level prerequisite. If replacing a metamorphosis causes you to no longer meet another metamorphosis’ prerequisites, you must also replace that metamorphosis. If you are replacing two or more metamorphoses simultaneously with this ability, you can choose a metamorphosis at the same time you choose its prerequisite metamorphosis. Crippling Jinx Prerequisite : 18th level, Enervating Jinx or Startling Jinx The following jinxes are added to the list of options you can choose when a creature fails its Wisdom saving throw against your Jinx feature: The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes. The target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes. Once you use this jinx on a creature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it on that creature again. Dispelling Anathema Prerequisite : 18th level, Capacious Anathema or Obstinate Anathema You learn the dispel caster UAH spell if you don’t already know it. It doesn’t count against the number of accursed spells you know. You can cast dispel caster once, without expending a spell slot. When you do, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it with this ability again. Additionally, when you make an ability check as part of your Arcane Anathema, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check. Doubling Jinx Prerequisite : 18th level, Enervating Jinx or Startling Jinx When you use your Jinx, you can target a second creature within range. If both targets fail their Wisdom saving throw against the feature, you can choose a different jinx for each target. If neither jinxed target makes the associated type of roll before the end of your next turn, you can use the same action to maintain both jinxes, given that the jinx hasn’t ended for another reason and you are able to maintain the jinx. Facile Suppression Prerequisite : 18th level, Instinctual Suppression or Resistant Suppression You can use your Suppress at will, without expending a spell slot. When you use Suppress with this ability, the Suppress doesn’t end until you die or until you choose to end it (no action required). Explosive Bane Prerequisite : 18th level, Eldritch Bane or Martial Bane Once during each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack or deal damage to it with an accursed spell, you can cause the target to take an additional 1d8 necrotic damage from the attack or spell. When you use this ability, you can also choose to expend a spell slot to cause the creature to take an additional 1d8 necrotic damage per level of the expended spell slot. Hex Phalanx Prerequisite : 18th level, Hex Aura or Hex Plate Your curse recognizes your allies and will protect them while they are alongside you. As long as one or more friendly creatures are within 5 feet of you, each of those creatures gains a bonus to its AC, and you and each of those creatures gains a bonus to any Strength or Dexterity saving throw it makes. The bonus is equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum +1). You and at least one friendly creature within 5 feet of you must be conscious to gain the bonus. Hex Shield Prerequisite : 18th level, Hex Aura or Hex Plate You can concentrate your curse’s magicks to deflect weapons and magic. Whenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to halve the amount of damage you take. Immune Suppression Prerequisite : 18th level, Instinctual Suppression or Resistant Suppression When you use your Suppress, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder. You gain immunity to the chosen damage type until the Suppress ends or you use your Suppress again. Insidious Imprecation Prerequisite : 18th level, Muffling Imprecation or Sleighting Imprecation If you’re hidden from a creature when one of your accursed features or an accursed spell you cast requires the creature to make a saving throw, it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell or feature this turn. Negating Anathema Prerequisite : 18th level, Capacious Anathema or Obstinate Anathema When you become the target of a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to negate the spell’s effects on yourself. If the spell is of 5th level or lower, the spell fails to affect you. If the spell is of 6th level or higher, you must make a curse ability check with DC equal to 15 + the spell’s level; on a success, the spell fails to affect you. You must be able to see the source of the spell to use this ability, and this ability has no effect on the spell’s other targets. Scourge Attunement Prerequisite : 18th Level, Scourge Sense or Scourge Visage You can attune to three additional magic items, provided that each of the additional items is cursed. If a cursed item you’re attuned to is a weapon or suit of armor, you are considered proficient with the item for the duration of your attunement to it. Scourge Presence Prerequisite : 18th Level, Scourge Sense or Scourge Visage As a bonus action, you can force each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. At the start of each of its turns, a creature frightened by this ability takes 2d8 psychic damage if it can see or hear you, or can repeat the saving throw if it can’t see or hear you, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ability until you finish a long rest. Transferring Affliction Prerequisite : 18th level, Infectious Affliction or Prolific Affliction When one or more creatures fail their saving throw against your Afflict, you can choose to ignore the effects of the chosen ailment for the duration. If you do, the afflicted creature has disadvantage on saving throws it makes to end its affliction and takes 1d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns for the duration. Umbral Imprecation Prerequisite : 18th level, Muffling Imprecation or Sleighting Imprecation If you don’t already have darkvision, you gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. Magical darkness doesn’t impede your darkvision. Additionally, your curse creates a shadowy gloom around you. While in an area of bright light, you count as being in dim light; while in an area of dim light, you count as being in darkness; and while in an area of darkness, you count as being in magical darkness. Vengeful Bane Prerequisite : 18th level, Eldritch Bane or Martial Bane When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you causes you to take damage, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against that creature or cast an accursed spell at the creature, given that the creature is within range. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and target only that creature. If the creature would take damage from the attack or spell, it takes additional necrotic damage equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum 1). Vile Affliction Prerequisite : 18th level, Infectious Affliction or Prolific Affliction You can use your Afflict as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, when you use your Afflict, you can choose any number of your ailments. If a target fails its saving throw, it suffers each of the chosen ailments for the duration. Malediction Metamorphosis Trees The “trees” created by the metamorphoses’ prerequisites can be hard to understand by simply reading them. Below is a visual representation of how these trees work, based on what family of metamorphoses they belong to. Conquered Curses Accurseds, once they take control of the magic of their curse, find themselves in a rather unique situation: they are able to study the malediction in ways that few other creatures can, learning the true makeup of its magicks. Most are surprised to find that the common beliefs held about the nature of their particular affliction are misconceptions, though this isn’t the case for all accurseds. Learning to utilize the core of their curse’s magic is at the heart of an accursed’s progression of power.

        "description": "The destiny of Rokugan rests in mortal hands, but that does not mean that cosmic powers never deign to push the outcome in one direction or another. Acolytes are the mortal agents of immortal causes. Unlike ritualists, who invoke the power of spirits and gods through ceremony and practice, acolytes bring this power into their bodies and souls, altering their mortal identities to accommodate such vast and unknowable depths. Thus, the abilities of acolytes are often subtle, yet incredibly impactful in their execution. These abilities are often externalized through marks of power, such as mystical tattoos or brands that appear on the body, symbolizing and amplifying the acolyte’s bond to a greater cosmic force. Traditions From the perspective of the world, acolytes are extremely rare compared to the other classes in Adventures in Rokugan . Thus, there are few acolyte traditions. Two are covered in this book, though the GM and players should certainly feel free to create others, for which the GM and players could work together to reinterpret the flavor of the abilities of one of these traditions as desired. Togashi Order Togashi did not leave behind a dynasty of lineal descendants like his siblings. However, he did create a family to carry on his legacy: the Togashi Order. Members of the order are the reincarnations of Togashi’s original followers in life, finding their way back to the High House of Light in the mountainous Dragon lands each lifetime. The order helps these individuals to expand their abilities across multiple lifetimes, tattooing them with signs of their spiritual progress. These tattoos, derived from the lifeblood of Togashi himself, act as channels to his power, allowing his acolytes to wield incredible abilities as the founder of the Dragon Clan once did. Through his acolytes, Togashi is able to carry on his grand design even though he has not been seen in the flesh in centuries. Acolytes of Shadow It is from Nothing that the universe sprang and, some say, to Nothing it will return. The primal uncreation is a force of the cosmos beyond good or evil, without will or thought, yet it hungers all the same. There are orders of philosophical practitioners dedicated to its study, to harnessing its unfathomable power through careful meditation and study…and then there are acolytes who leap headlong into the abyss. How the secret of Shadow Brands came to the Scorpion Clan is unknown, but by sealing a sliver of the abyss into one’s own body in the form of a tenebrous mark, and by letting some part of the primal uncreation into themselves, the bearer of the Shadow Brand can crack reality itself in their favor. Yet as a Shadow Brand grows in power, so too does the hungering shard of unmaking they have let into their body and soul… Quick Builds If you select the Acolyte of Togashi archetype, make Strength your highest ability score, then make sure your Constitution is high so that you can stay in the fray of battle. If you select the Acolyte of Shadows archetype, make Dexterity your highest ability score, then make Wisdom your next highest ability score to avoid being caught unawares. A number of iconic acolytes can be found in the more detailed quick builds provided in the Backgrounds section, such as the Togashi Tattooed Acolyte and Soshi Shadow Agent.

Once per turn, when you roll a 1 on a die for a skill check, saving throw, attack roll, or damage roll, you gain inspiration. You can’t use this feature and your Renewing Purpose feature on the same turn. Disciplined Approach At 7th level, when you would roll a d20, you can instead roll 2d10 and use the total result of those d10s in the d20’s place. A result of 1 on either die or both dice counts as a 1 for the purpose of your class and archetype features, such as Renewing Purpose. You cannot score critical hits when rolling this way. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest. You also regain the use of this feature when you use your Renewing Purpose feature. Expanded Mind Starting at 10th level, you become capable of seeing the path the world has set forth for you. During your turn, you can give yourself inspiration as a free action. At the GM’s discretion, you also learn something important to your quest in the form of a small sign from the cosmos, such as a breeze blowing gently in the direction you should travel or a stone on the road signifying that your destination lies in the mountains. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest. A Greater Purpose At 13th level, some cosmic power has greater things in store for you than an ignoble death. After you succeed at a death saving throw, you can regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. After you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest.

These are not the only beings who bind themselves to greater powers in Rokugan and the lands beyond, but they are among of the most iconic of Rokugan and its myths.

        "name": "Adept",
        "description": "Calling upon her training and discipline to steel herself, the kesh shifts her stance and gazes ahead of her. Her vision sharpens to see the different shapes and lines made up of millions of paths of energy between herself and her target, all of which are conduits for her psychic power. She summons her inner energies, harnessing them into her fist. She smiles as she unleashes the energy upon its chosen path to vanquish her foe. Wielders of psionic power, adepts use their inner focus and sheer force of will to manipulate the energies stored within the minds of each living thing. Adepts can see and translate the pathways of the mind and body and can use those connections as conduits for psychic ability. Those with this power have also been referred to as Psions. Focused and Determined Adepts possess a supersensory view of the universe, able to see the immaterial connection between all living things. While this may occur with many who gain the ability of an esper, an adept has turned this dynamic link into an art form. With constant training, focus, meditation, and exercise, both their body and mind become in sync with each other as well as with the psychic energies of all living things around them. This psychic link is what adepts use to channel their powers. Unlike melders, who draw external energies into themselves, an adept’s power comes from within. Their bolstered essence is channeled outward to affect the physical and metaphysical essences of other objects and lifeforms. Harmony of Spirit With an adept’s rigid dedication to training and exercise comes an awakening of the senses which can only be described as a harmonius pattern. Very similar to a melder, who breaks these patterns down into codes and symbols, an adept instead sees interconnections between these energies and how each of them intersect and interact with the adept’s own form. Such a view of the universe and the feeling that comes with it is what drives an adept’s art and their pursuit of what they see as transendence from the mundane world. Even when channeling their powers, the movements and stances they perform can appear to be almost like a form of dance, as they release their inner energies along those invisible threads of power. Creating an Adept When you create your adept, consider your connection with the world around you. Are you able to see and influence the thoughts and feelings of others? Can you manipulate and move matter with your mind? Can you alter the molecular structure of other objects, or perhaps even that of your own body? How did you come upon this power and how does it relate to your life experiences? Ability Scores Charisma should be your highest ability score followed by Wisdom. Constitution and Intelligence are also useful.

See chapter 10 for general rules on esper powers and chapter 11 for the adept powers list. Prime Talents At 1st level, you know psi blast and two prime talents of your choice from the adept powers list. You learn additional prime talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Prime Talents column on the Adept table. Talent Points The Adept table shows you how many talent points you have. You can expend your talent points to activate a known talent of rank 1 or higher. Once your pool of talent points is depleted, you are on the brink of exhaustion. Your regain all of your points once you finish a long rest. Each talent has a rank and a point cost associated with it. If you don’t have enough talent points to cover the cost, you can’t use the talent. Talents Known of Rank 1 and Higher You know two rank 1 talents of your choice from the adept powers list. The Talents Known column of the Adept table shows when you learn more talents of your choice. A talent you choose must be no higher than what’s shown in the Max Talent Rank column for your level. When you reach 5th level, for example, you learn a new talent, which can be from any rank between 1 and 3. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose from one of the adept talents you know and replace it with another talent from the adept powers list, which must also be of a rank no higher than your Max Talent Rank. Channeling Ability Charisma is your channeling ability for your esper powers, so you use your Charisma whenever a power refers to your channeling ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an adept power you use and when making an attack roll with one. Channeling save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Channeling attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Esper Recovery Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover a number of talent points equal to 2 plus half of your adept level (rounded down). Psychic Paradigm At 1st level, you choose a paradigm which determines the source of your supersensory abilities: animota, battlemind, and dreamshaper. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. Intellect Fortress At 2nd level, your purity of mind and focus grants you advantage to saving throws versus being charmed or frightened. Psionic Combat At 3rd level, your gain the ability to combine your physical and mental energies into fluid and graceful movements to be utilized as offensive and defensive stances. You start with two of the following combat modes and learn one additional combat mode when you reach 13th level. Your Psychic Paradigm feature can also grant you additional combat modes at higher levels. You can use your Psionic Combat feature twice. When you use this feature, you choose which combat mode to activate. You regain all uses of your Psionic Combat feature after you finish a long rest. Some Psionic Combat effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your channeling save DC. Beginning at 10th level, you can use your Psionic Combat three times between long rests, and four times between long rests at 17th level. Psionic Combat: Improved Psi Blast When you hit with your psi blast , each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 psychic damage. The additional damage on a failed save increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10). Psionic Combat: Mind Spike As an action, you send a surge of psychic energy into another creature in attempt to overload their senses. Make a ranged channeling attack at a creature within 90 feet of you that you can see. On a hit, the creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or their movement is reduced by half until the end of their next turn. The additional damage increases by 2d8 when you reach 5th level (4d8), 9th level (6d8) and 13th level (8d8). Psionic Combat: Mental Barrier This feature can be used in one of two ways. When you are hit with an attack that deals psychic damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage from the triggering attack. When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or radiant damage, you can use your reaction and gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Beginning at 11th level, when you use this combat mode, you take no damage from the triggering attack. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Esper Mastery At 11th level, your attunement to the fundamental forces around you grants you the ability to channel advanced esper talents. Choose a rank 6 talent from the adept powers list. You can activate this power once by spending the required amount of talent points. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more adept talents of your choice that you can use in this way: One rank 7 at 13th level, one rank 8 at 15th level and one rank 9 at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Esper Mastery when you finish a long rest. Psionic Recovery At 20th level, you regain one use of your Psionic Combat feature when you finish a short rest, after which you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Psychic Paradigms Upon their awakening, each adept chooses a path of specialization, each devoted to a specific set of disciplines. In some areas of the galaxy, groups of adepts establish training academies, both in large cities and in secluded regions away from civilization. An adept, regardless of origin, finds their own style of training and development, but all still begin with a set of established basics. The following paradigms are common amongst adepts encountered throughout the Silrayne Arc. Each paradigm has a list of talents associated with it which is added to the adept powers list.

        "name": "Alchemist",
        "description": "A grinning gnome cackles with glee as he hurls a bomb into a group of charging goblins, blasting them into scorched chunks. He produces another, throws it at his feet, and disappears, still laughing, into the ensuing cloud of smoke. A slender elf quickly mixes liquids and herbs in a small bowl. She applies the mixture to an arrow wound on an injured dwarf’s side, which immediately stops bleeding. Whether their methods are explosive, transformative, or restorative, alchemists live to transmute the world around them to their liking. Chemical Reactions One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists regularly apply this knowledge to create bombs. An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles. Serums and Tinctures More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances into potions, alchemical concoctions that replicate magical effects. These potions range from the medicinal, such as potions of healing , to the transformative, such as potions of gaseous form , to the downright deadly, such as potions of poison . Undisputed masters of potions, alchemists constantly innovate with new formulations and preparations, improving their potions into magic items in their own right. Elemental Sciences The primary source of alchemy’s power comes from the elemental planes. It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher’s stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher’s stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets. Creating an Alchemist When you create an alchemist, consider why you study alchemy. Are you attracted to its dangerous power or its ability to help others? Do you desire to use magic, but lack the aptitude or inborn ability? Why do you adventure? Are you searching for new alchemical formulae or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher’s stone? Be sure to understand alchemy’s place in your campaign world. You might have learned your trade from a master or studied alongside artificers and wizards in a university. Your trade might be commonplace or an oddity. Depending on the setting, you might be respected for your knowledge or feared for your destructive potential. Quick Build You can make an alchemist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Choose any background of your choice, preferably one that lends insight into your history with alchemy.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d6 per alchemist level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per alchemist level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, bombs Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, herbalism kit Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence Skills: Choose three from Arcana, History, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) an explorer’s pack or (b) a scholar’s pack Alchemist’s supplies and (a) a vial of acid, (b) a flask of alchemist’s fire, or (c) a vial of basic poison Leather armor and a dagger Natural Philosopher You have learned much about alchemy during your studies. Starting at 1st level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded up, to any ability check you make to identify herbs, potions, poisons, or other alchemical substances. If the ability check already includes your proficiency bonus, you can add this bonus in addition to your normal proficiency bonus. Bombs At 1st level, you can create volatile alchemical bombs using your alchemist’s supplies. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can create a number of bombs equal to 10 + twice your alchemist level. For you the cost of materials necessary to create these bombs is negligible. After 24 hours, an unused bomb becomes inert. The statistics of a bomb are shown in the Bomb sidebar above. Priming Bombs. Once per turn you can take the Use an Object action to prime a bomb with explosive reagents and make an attack with it, increasing the bomb’s explosive potential. When you do so, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, to the bomb’s damage roll. Additionally, when you throw a bomb in this way, its damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). Saving Throws. When you throw a bomb, the save DC for its blast radius is calculated as follows: Bomb save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Bomb Bombs are exotic ranged weapons with the following statistics: Name Cost Damage Weight Properties Bomb 2 sp 1d10 fire 1 lb. Finesse, special, thrown (range 30/90) Special Property Bomb. When a bomb hits a target, it explodes in a 15-foot diameter sphere and is destroyed. The bomb can be thrown at an unoccupied space within its range. Each creature other than the target within the blast radius (for a Medium or smaller target, each creature within 5 feet of it) must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking half the damage rolled on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can empty some of the bomb’s explosive material to permanently remove the blast radius from this bomb, dealing damage only to the bomb’s target. Bomb Formulae By 2nd level, your research has granted you insight into new alchemical formulations for your bombs. Select three bomb formulae from the Bomb Formulae section. Once per turn when you prime a bomb, you can apply a formula to it. Applying a formula sometimes changes all of the damage dice rolled for a bomb, but also grants it special effects. When you gain certain levels in this class, you learn additional formulae of your choice, as shown in the Bomb Formulae Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the formulae you know and replace it with another formula. Field of Study While all alchemists share a common knowledge base, most alchemists specialize into a particular field of study. When you reach 2nd level, you select your field of study, which grants you features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level. A formula granted by your field of study doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know. Reagent Starting at 3rd level, you have a collection of powerful alchemical reagents, represented by a pool of reagent dice, that you can spend to brew potions or magnify the power of your explosives. Reagent Dice You start with three reagent dice, which are d10s, and you gain additional reagent dice as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Reagent Dice column of the Alchemist table. You regain all expended reagent dice when you finish a long rest. When you prime a bomb, you can expend a number of reagent dice up to your proficiency bonus and add the dice to the bomb’s damage roll. Brewing Potions You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of reagent dice to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls for a saving throw, it uses your bomb save DC. The number of reagent dice and the alchemist level required to brew a potion are given on the Potions table. Potions Potion Cost Level Potion of Climbing 1 reagent die 3rd Potion of Growth 1 reagent die 3rd Potion of Healing 1 reagent die 3rd Potion of Water Breathing 1 reagent die 3rd Universal Solvent 1 reagent die 3rd Cure-All 2 reagent dice 7th Potion of Greater Healing 2 reagent dice 7th Potion of Heroism 2 reagent dice 7th Potion of Resistance 2 reagent dice 7th Sovereign Glue (1 ounce) 2 reagent dice 7th Potion of Diminution 3 reagent dice 14th Potion of Flying 4 reagent dice 14th Potion of Hill Giant Strength 4 reagent dice 14th Potion of Invisibility 4 reagent dice 14th Potion of Superior Healing 4 reagent dice 14th Reagent Synthesis When you finish a short rest, you can choose to regain all of your expended reagent dice that weren’t used to brew potions. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Discoveries In the course of your research, you have made a number of discoveries regarding the nature of alchemy. At 4th level, you gain two discoveries of your choice. When you gain certain alchemist levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries Known column of the Alchemist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, as an alchemist, when you gain an ability score improvement, you can instead choose to learn a new discovery for which you meet the prerequisites. Flashbang Beginning at 5th level, you carry a supply of concussive explosives to help you escape from perilous situations. As a bonus action, you can throw one of these explosives at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. Evasion Beginning at 11th level, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Blast Coating Starting at 15th level, you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own bombs and never take damage from them. Philosopher’s Stone At 20th level, you unlock the crowning achievement of all alchemy: a philosopher’s stone, a dynamo of alchemical energy in a fist-sized, glowing jewel. You can construct your philosopher’s stone using your alchemist’s supplies, 1,000 gp worth of materials, and 7 days of work. You can only have one philosopher’s stone at a time. As long as you possess the stone, you gain the following benefits: Whenever you finish a short rest, you regain all expended reagent dice. You can brew potions as an action, instead of over the course of 10 minutes. You age 10 times slower than normal, and you can’t be aged magically. Additionally, you learn the following formula, which doesn’t count against the total number of formulae you know: Formula: Nuclear Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with your philosopher’s stone, you can change it into a nuclear bomb. A nuclear bomb deals 10d10 + 100 force damage instead of its normal fire damage, has a blast radius of 1 mile, and completely destroys the philosopher’s stone. Additionally, each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw takes the full bomb damage rolled, or half as much damage on a successful save. Creatures within 60 feet of the bomb gain no benefit from Evasion or similar features. Bomb Formulae Bomb formulae are summarized on the following table. Bombs that are exclusively available to one field of study are marked with an asterisk. Unless otherwise stated, all bombs produce a loud boom, audible out to one mile. Bombs are presented in alphabetical order. Bomb Formulae Formula Damage Saving Throw Acid Bomb d4 acid Dexterity Arcano Bomb* d12 force Dexterity Black Powder Bomb* d12 fire Dexterity Bramble Bomb — — Cryo Bomb d8 cold Constitution Holy Bomb d8 radiant Dexterity Impact Bomb d8 force Dexterity Incendiary Bomb d6 fire Dexterity Laughing Gas Bomb d6 poison Constitution Lightning Bomb d8 lightning Dexterity Nonlethal Bomb d8 bludg.

For simplicity, we assume that missed bombs explode harmlessly in the background or fail to detonate altogether, but do not explode in the target’s space or deal damage within their blast radius. The GM can decide which of these two outcomes happens or can determine the outcome randomly. Acid Bomb By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of ardenflotic acid, a highly corrosive chemical, you can change it into an acid bomb. An acid bomb deals acid damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d4s. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, takes the same amount of damage again at the end of its next turn. Bramble Bomb By adding a potent fertilizer to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a bramble bomb. A bramble bomb deals no damage, but instead causes tough, thorny brambles to sprout from any area of natural ground within the bomb’s blast radius, which becomes difficult terrain. Additionally, if a creature in the blast radius is prone when the bomb detonates, it is enveloped by the brambles and must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check against your bomb save DC before it can move or stand. The brambles shrivel and die after 1 minute. Cryo Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a piece of ice-nine, you can change it into a cryo bomb. A cryo bomb deals cold damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. Holy Bomb By adding a few drops of holy water to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a holy bomb. A holy bomb deals radiant damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s, unless the target is a Celestial, Fiend, or Undead. The bomb’s damage dice are d6s against Celestials and d12s against Fiends and Undead. Impact Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with more reactive ones, you can change it into an impact bomb. An impact bomb deals force damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is pushed 5 feet away from the center of the blast. A bomb for every occasion! Incendiary Bomb By adding a thickening agent to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into an incendiary bomb. An incendiary bomb’s damage dice are d6s. Additionally, the area of the blast radius is engulfed in flames, which persist until the start of your next turn. Flammable objects in this area that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. Any creature that ends its turn in this area takes half the bomb’s damage. Laughing Gas Bomb By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a drop of jesterate, a highly euphoric chemical, you can change it into a laughing gas bomb. A laughing gas bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d6s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, falls prone in a fit of laughter. Once a creature falls prone due to this bomb’s effects, it is immune to this effect (but not the bomb’s poison damage) for the next 24 hours. Lightning Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a charged arcane capacitor, you can change it into a lightning bomb. A lightning bomb deals lightning damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn. Nonlethal Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a pouch of rubber pellets, you can change it into a nonlethal bomb. A nonlethal bomb deals bludgeoning damage instead of fire damage, and its damage dice are d8s. If damage from this bomb drops a creature to 0 hit points, it knocks the creature out, rather than dealing a killing blow, rendering the creature unconscious and stable. Additionally, this bomb’s rubber pellets bounce around corners, ignoring half and three-quarters cover for targets within the blast radius. Oil Bomb By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of a super-surfactant, you can change it into an oil bomb. An oil bomb deals no damage, but coats each creature within the blast radius in a sticky, flammable oil. The next time a creature coated in oil takes fire damage, it takes an extra d6 fire damage for each die of fire damage rolled, up to a maximum of half your alchemist level, rounded up. This oil can be removed by dousing a creature with a gallon of water. Prismatic Bomb By adding an ounce of polyjuice, an unpredictable, multicolored chemical, to your bomb’s explosive contents, you can change it into a prismatic bomb. A prismatic bomb deals damage of a randomly determined type instead of fire damage, and it requires a randomly determined type of saving throw. Its damage dice are d8s. Roll on each of the following tables. d6 Damage Type d6 Saving Throw 1 Acid 1–2 Dexterity 2 Cold 3–4 Constitution 3 Fire 5–6 Wisdom 4 Lightning 5 Poison 6 Radiant Psionic Bomb By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with dust from a psionic crystal, you can change it into a psionic bomb. A psionic bomb deals psychic damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d6s, and it requires a Wisdom saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws it makes to maintain concentration on spells until the end of its next turn, including against this bomb’s damage. Quiet Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a wad of thermal cotton, you can change it into a quiet bomb. A quiet bomb’s damage dice are d8s. When this bomb detonates, it makes only a low thud, audible out to 10 feet, and releases a puff of smoke to mask the light given off by its blast. Creatures have disadvantage on ability checks to detect that this bomb was detonated nearby. Seeking Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a powerful lodestone, you can change it into a seeking bomb. A seeking bomb’s damage dice are d6s. You don’t have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls you make using this bomb as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature. Smoke Bomb By removing your bomb’s explosive contents entirely, you can change it into a smoke bomb. A smoke bomb deals no damage but fills a 10-foot-radius sphere with smoke. This smoke spreads around corners and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 round) or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Once you throw one of these bombs, you can’t throw another one for 1 minute. Sonic Bomb By mixing your bomb’s explosive contents with a few drops of air elemental essence, you can change it into a sonic bomb. A sonic bomb deals thunder damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d6s, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, is deafened until the end of its next turn. Stink Bomb By adding a single drop of skunkanide, a chemical too unholy to expound upon, you can change it into a stink bomb. A stink bomb deals poison damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8, and it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, has disadvantage on ability checks it makes until the end of its next turn. Teleportation Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a glowing etherite crystal, you can change it into a teleportation bomb. A teleportation bomb deals no damage and instead opens a rift in space, instantly teleporting you to its point of detonation. This effect fails if the bomb explodes more than 30 feet away from you. Thermobaric Bomb By replacing your bomb’s explosive contents with a lower speed explosive, you can change it into a thermobaric bomb. A thermobaric bomb’s damage dice are d6s, and it explodes in a 10-foot radius. Withering Bomb By mixing your bomb’s explosive components with a powerful desiccating agent, you can change it into a withering bomb. A withering bomb deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage, its damage dice are d8s, it requires a Constitution saving throw, instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the target, as well as each creature within the blast radius that fails its saving throw, can’t regain hit points until the end of its next turn. Discoveries If a discovery has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the discovery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. You can only learn a discovery once, unless otherwise specified. Advanced Poisoner Prerequisites: 13th level, Venomsmith Field of Study Your morbid research into the most vicious, exotic poisons allows you to brew the following poisons (found in the SRD) when you brew potions: Potion Cost Burnt Othur Fumes 3 reagent dice Crawler Mucus 3 reagent dice Drow Poison 3 reagent dice Pale Tincture 4 reagent dice Midnight Tears 5 reagent dice Wyvern Poison 6 reagent dice Alchemy of Ascendancy Prerequisite: 17th level A breakthrough in your alchemical studies has revealed the formulation of several potent elixirs. You can brew the following potions: Potion Cost Necromantic Draught 4 reagent dice Oil of Etherealness 4 reagent dice Potion of Speed 4 reagent dice Potion of Stone Giant Strength 4 reagent dice Alchemy of Influence Prerequisite: 13th level Your alchemical research has revealed many of the basic chemicals that govern emotions. You can brew the following potions: Potion Cost Potion of Animal Friendship 1 reagent die Philter of Love 2 reagent dice Potion of Clairvoyance 3 reagent dice Potion of Mind Reading 3 reagent dice Alchemy of Transformation Prerequisite: 13th level You have mastered the alchemical secrets of shifting matter, which allow you to brew the following potions: Potion Cost Oil of Slipperiness 2 reagent dice Sandstone Solution 2 reagent dice Aqua Fortis 3 reagent dice Chameleon Concoction 3 reagent dice Potion of Gaseous Form 3 reagent dice Arcane Study You learn three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. Ballistics Research You learn two additional bomb formulae. Battle Training You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields. Beguiling Haze Prerequisites: 13th level, Amorist Field of Study When you charm a creature, you can choose to place it in a dreamy state, from which it regards everyone it sees as close friends. While the creature is charmed, it is nonhostile and acts as though it is charmed equally by each creature it sees. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Buffered Metabolism Prerequisites: 13th level, Xenoalchemist Field of Study As a reaction when you take damage, you can expend any number of reagent dice up to your proficiency bonus to reduce the amount of damage taken by the total rolled on the dice. Clotting Agent You have developed a serum that thickens your blood. Your hit point maximum increases by your alchemist level + your Constitution modifier, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Craft Homunculus Using a special alchemical process requiring 8 hours of work, which can be performed over the course of a long rest, you can create a homunculus. A homunculus functions as a familiar summoned by the find familiar spell, with several differences: The telepathic link between you and your homunculus functions at any distance, provided you and your homunculus are on the same plane of existence. You can’t dismiss your homunculus as you would a familiar. Your homunculus is a Construct and can’t assume a different form. Your homunculus can take the Attack action on its turn. When your homunculus dies, its body remains, and can be reanimated in a procedure requiring 1 hour of work, which can be performed over the course of a short or long rest. Demolition Spree Prerequisites: 13th level, Mad Bomber Field of Study When you prime and throw a bomb, you can choose to throw a number of bombs equal to the number of damage dice for the bomb instead of only one. Each bomb you throw deals 1d10 damage plus your Intelligence modifier and can’t target the same creature or space. You must spend reagent dice separately on these bombs and can apply a bomb formula to only one of them. Explosive Missile As a bonus action, you can load one of your bombs onto the head of a crossbow bolt. Instead of its normal damage, this bolt deals damage as if the bomb had been primed and thrown, but it doesn’t have a blast radius. Only one of your bombs can be loaded onto a bolt at a time, and you can’t fire an explosive bolt on the same turn you throw a bomb. Fire Brand As a bonus action you can mix your bomb’s contents together and apply the fiery concoction to a melee weapon you are holding. Until the end of your turn, this melee weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. This extra damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). Fire Eater Instead of priming and throwing a bomb, you use an action to drink its contents and spit them out in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your bomb save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage as if the bomb had been primed and thrown, or half as much on a successful save. When you use this ability, you take 1d4 points of fire damage for each of your bomb’s damage dice. Fire in the Hole Prerequisite: 9th level You have tweaked your bomb’s formula to increase its explosive yield. Your bomb save DC increases by half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. Fortified Serum Prerequisites: 13th level, Apothecary Field of Study Whenever a creature regains hit points by drinking one of your potions, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks until the end of its next turn. Grenadier When you prime and throw a bomb, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with a weapon that isn’t two-handed. Dynamo Charger Prerequisites: 13th level, Dynamo Engineer Field of Study You’ve invented a device that rapidly recharges your spell dynamos. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can regain 2 expended spell slots stored in dynamos. You can configure these dynamos immediately. Hemoreagent Prerequisite: 17th level When you prime and throw a bomb, you can convert a measure of your own blood into reagents. You can add five or fewer reagent dice to the bomb’s damage roll without expending them, and you lose 1d6 hit points for each reagent die added. This loss of hit points can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. Lazarus Bolt Prerequisite: 9th level You’ve discovered a radical necromantic workaround: restoring life with direct electricity to the heart. As an action, you can drive a bolt into the torso of a creature within 5 feet of you that has died within the last minute and shock it back to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This feature can’t return to life a creature that lacks a heart, a creature that has died of old age, or a creature that is missing vital organs. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Magnified Blast Prerequisite: 17th level Thanks to a new internal design for your bombs, you have expanded their blast radius and magnitude. Whenever you add reagent dice to your bomb’s damage, you can also choose to expand the bomb’s blast radius by a distance of up to 5 feet per two reagent dice spent. Ooze Cowboy Prerequisites: 13th level, Ooze Rancher Field of Study Tired of waiting for your Oozes to catch up with you, you’ve modified your formula to make extra fast slimes! All slimes you make have a speed of 30 feet, unless it was already higher. Additionally, you can ride any Ooze you make of Medium size or larger as a mount. You and your equipment suffer no ill effect from touching your Oozes directly. Lastly, your Oozes add your proficiency bonus to their damage rolls and initiative rolls. Poisoner Your research into poisonous compounds has taught you how to concoct lethal toxins. You gain proficiency with the poisoner’s kit. Additionally, you can craft the following poisons when you brew potions, which use your bomb save DC instead of their normal save DCs: Potion Cost 2 x Antitoxin 1 reagent die 2 x Basic Poison 1 reagent die Oil of Taggit 2 reagent dice Potion of Poison 2 reagent dice Serpent Venom 2 reagent dice Truth Serum 2 reagent dice Precision Explosives You have modified your bombs to have narrow gaps in their explosions, perfect for keeping some creatures safe from the blast. You can choose one creature in the blast radius of a bomb, other than the target, to automatically succeed on its saving throw against the bomb and take no damage from it. Reactionary Gulp Prerequisite: 17th level By keeping your potions organized on a bandolier or in a series of pouches, you can quickly draw them at a moment’s notice. Immediately after you take damage, you can use your reaction to drink a potion. Recycled Potions When you brew potions, you can distill potions you have already brewed, destroying them and regaining the reagent dice expended to brew them. You can choose to expend these reagent dice to create new potions. You can’t gain more than your maximum number of reagent dice using this ability. Syringe Using a sophisticated hypodermic needle, you can more quickly administer potions and poisons. As a bonus action, you can inject a potion into yourself or a willing creature within 5 feet of you, granting the benefits of the potion as if it were consumed normally. You can inject a potion into an unwilling creature with a successful melee attack, treating the syringe as a finesse weapon. Tri-Mutation Prerequisites: 13th level, Mutagenist Field of Study You’ve developed a powerful, but fleeting way to blend your mutagens. When you inject yourself with a mutagen, you can choose to inject a tri-mutagen, which grants you the benefit of all your mutagens at once. This benefit lasts for 1 minute, or until you inject yourself with a different mutagen. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Fields of Study All alchemists learn the basics of their science: the elements, chemical reactions, and alchemical formulae. Beyond that, alchemists pick up a specialty that they practice and research in depth. Some focus on the healing arts and some focus on destruction, while others focus on research or potion-brewing. Fields of study are as varied as the alchemists who research them and have applications equally as diverse. Fields of Study Name Description Amorist Brewers of love potions and practitioners of mind-affecting alchemy Apothecary Alchemical healers and herbalists Dynamo Engineer Casts spells by preparing them in devices known as spell dynamos Mad Bomber Pyromaniacs who fashion particularly devastating bombs Mutagenist Transmutes their body with experimental, injected mutagens Ooze Rancher Breeds and commands all manner of oozes and slimes Venomsmith Poison expert and assassin Xenoalchemist Modifies their body and the bodies of others with monster surgery Never underestimate the power of blowing things up!",

You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don’t issue a command, the Beast takes the Dodge action. If you gain the Extra Attack feature or another feature that allows you to attack twice when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to command the Beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated or absent, the Beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The Beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

        "name": "Apothecary",
        "description": "Apothecary A bespectacled man stands at an operating table, studying the dissected monstrosity resting upon the slab. The crackle of electric conductors harmonize with his arcane mumblings as he takes up his scalpels and saws. As he finishes the final stitch, the creature's hand twitches and jolts to life once more. Cloaked in an acid-stained heavy coat, a tall half-elf brews tinctures and tonics. Her face is concealed behind thick black goggles and a heavy breathing mask as she performs an unusual combination of herbalism, alchemy, medicine, and magic. Her mixtures bubble and boil as she muses whether the cure will be worse than the disease. A lithe tiefling soothes a suffering patient as they draw a sample of contaminated blood. Lifting the vial to examine the liquid within, they pull upon eldritch energy to distill the sample into a pure contagion. Scribbling their findings down in a withered notebook, they add the vial to their collection of pathogens and scourges to use against their foes. Medical Experts An apothecary is a practiced medical expert and arcane magic user. They wield their knowledge to both heal and harm, augmenting their conventional skills with alchemy and occult magic. Some apothecaries might first attempt treatment with traditional means like medicinal herbs and surgical techniques. When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, and some apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose. Their careful study of life and death gives an apothecary the tools to both help allies survive horrible ailments, injuries, and pluck them from the clutches of death, or use their enemies as test subjects for their dangerous compounds, terrible diseases and poisonous magic. Knowledge Seekers Most apothecaries set out with the goal of furthering their studies and expanding their magical horizons, uncovering new ways to wield magic for dangerous or life-saving effects, and learning forbidden knowledge kept from the rest of the world. They believe that knowledge is power, and see themselves as seekers of knowledge. Some kinder apothecaries see their duty as protectors of the innocent, dedicating their lives to helping sick and injured people. Others see every opportunity to exploit the weak and push their search for true power forward. Many fall somewhere in between, riding the lines of mad scientist and renowned doctor. Occult Practitioners Apothecaries seek out occult lore and use it to study and practice scientific theories. Many of their magical incantations, whether it be for the purposes of saving lives, or ending them, are deemed experimental. Many apothecaries keep a notebook close at hand and write down esoteric theories based on their findings and field work. Apothecaries are gaining renown within some remote communities on the continent as doctors and healers to whom one can turn to instead of religious figures. However, they are more often viewed as dangerous scientists and mysterious witches who use magic to create toxins and poisons that could eradicate entire armies. Creating an Apothecary When you set out to create an apothecary, the most important question is to decide your path of study. What is it that drives you to seek knowledge? Are you working in the service of good? Is your life dedicated to helping those in need? By studying poisons, diseases, occult lore, and forbidden knowledge, do you hope to help the sick and wounded? Perhaps you aim to save someone you care about, or protect your kingdom or homeland from the evils of this world. Or maybe your studies are more dangerous in nature. Do you set out on adventure to test your dangerous chemical formulae? Do you see each monster or enemy as a test subject for your concoctions and spells? All apothecaries share a search for knowledge, and dabble in forbidden lore and occult practices. Although many in their practice are happy to sell their services or potions in cities or to well-paying nobles and kings, some are called to adventure, setting out on the endless hunt for knowledge. Others work as investigators and researchers. Many apothecaries see adventure as a means to perform direct field research, perfect their skills, and test the true potential of their theories. Quick Build You can make an apothecary quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose your character ancestry and background. Third, choose the Poison Needle * and Spare the Dying cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells Envenom * and Healing Word . Apothecaries in Drakkenheim Apothecaries can be found throughout the continent in many forms. The term is broadly used to describe many magic-adjacent professions found on the continent and the vast array of possible fields of study is ever expanding. The Amethyst Academy has departments of apothecaries managing their labs and research centers. Within their many schools and strongholds, they teach advanced sciences and using magic to better understand the body and mind, and the various modern medical practices that can be combined with magic to save lives — or end them. Not all apothecaries are mageborn. The broad term has been used to describe several practices that combine herbal ingredients, chemicals, and poisons with biological study to induce outcomes similar to the effects of evocation or necromantic magic. Pathogenists working in distant labs perform studies to create new powerful strains of disease and poison. Chemists find ways to surpass the potency of mageborn spellcasting with the right dose of chemicals for their explosive and destructive results. Other Mutagenists working with the mutating effects of delerium seek to control and isolate the elements of mutation and apply them in a more controlled manner. There are even reports of apothecaries who are studying techniques to unlock the potential of the mind. These Alienists have caused a stir amongst nobles, mages, and clergy for their ability to tap into mental capabilities that mirror magic, without requiring a mageborn's lineage. Secretive reanimators pursue grisly studies into the realms of death and undeath, mimicking necromantic magic using little more than new science and invention. There are apothecaries working under the Sacred Flame as exorcists, channeling their occult knowledge and research into helping rid holy sites of undead, dispatch unwanted spirits, and remove terrible curses. Apothecaries are found on every continent; whether mageborn or not, many are skilled academics who have a keen mind for pushing the boundaries of science. These researchers have found themselves on the path of the apothecary, lending their aid to cities and towns throughout the continent, and occasionally bringing unique chemical warfare to the battlefield of great wars. Personality Traits 1 I often use big scientific words; I just can't help but to embellish my superior intellect. 2 I have a dark sense of humor. Often my jokes fall flat on those who do not share in my macabre ideals. 3 I mutter to myself constantly. Years in the lab have meant that I am accustomed to speaking mostly to myself. Ideals 1 Science. To push the boundaries of mortal capabilities is a reason to live, and a worthy legacy to leave behind. 2 Education. If I can share the great secrets I learn with others, the world will be better for it. 3 Power. Mageborn think they hold all the cards, but the power we can unlock through occult practice and advanced study will surpass any silly fireball-throwing mage. Bonds 1 I was laughed at for my passion for study. I want to prove to the world how great science can be. 2 There are secrets of this world capable of unlocking vast mortal potential — I will discover them. 3 My mentor was a great genius. I want to finish the work they started. Flaws 1 Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to prove a hypothesis. Sometimes those sacrifices are people's lives. A worthy cost for science, no? 2 I obsess over my theories and discovering occult lore; occasionally it is all consuming. 3 I scoff at mages and their petty parlor tricks. They cannot fathom the power we can wield if we simply seek it. Personal Quest 1 I must collect blood samples of the five chromatic dragons in order to perfect the ultimate concoction. 2 I will be the first non-mageborn to prove the potential of scientific study and join the Amethyst Academy elite. 3 The falling star that struck Drakkenheim is sure to have unfathomable potential for my study. I must collect a shard from the source in the heart of the crater.

Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two skills from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: a Light Crossbow and 20 bolts, a Shortsword , or any simple weapon a Component Pouch or an arcane focus a Scholar's Pack or a Dungeoneer's Pack Hide Armor , any simple weapon, and two Daggers A Healer's Kit Apothecary Magic Your arcane research has given you facility with spells. Refer to the Core Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing in this book for the apothecary spell list. Formula Book You have a book or collection of notes that you study to prepare your apothecary spells, develop your Esoteric Theories , and record your occult practices. You may use your formula book as an arcane focus for your apothecary spells. You may describe this book any way you like. Some examples of your book's appearance include: A large leatherbound tome with yellowing pages bound shut with an iron lock A scattered assortment of scribbled notes loosely held together by rope A pristine journal with perfect edges and beautiful penmanship A leather briefcase with two small golden locks A medical bag with surgical symbols on the sides A beat-up satchel slung over one shoulder with vials and bottles poking out of every pocket If the book is destroyed or lost, you can recreate it using inks and paper during a long rest. Cantrips You know three cantrips of your choice from the apothecary spell list. You learn additional apothecary cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Apothecary table. Elementary Reformulation. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one apothecary cantrip you know with another cantrip from the apothecary spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells The Apothecary table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your apothecary spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your apothecary spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. You prepare the list of apothecary spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the apothecary spell list. When you do so, choose a number of apothecary spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + your apothecary level (minimum of one spell). A spell you prepare must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Apothecary table's Slot Level column for your level. For example, if you are a 5th-level apothecary, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include eight spells of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level, in any combination. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of apothecary spells requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your apothecary spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and occult knowledge. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an apothecary spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast an apothecary spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section of the Core Rules) as a spellcasting focus for your apothecary spells. Occult Practices At 1st level, you take up one of the Occult Practices , a chosen discipline which defines your ongoing research of the body and spirit: the Alienist , the Chemist , the Exorcist , the Mutagenist , the Pathogenist , or the Reanimator . Your choice grants you additional proficiencies and an expanded spell list at 1st level, and additional class features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. Esoteric Theories You have discovered esoteric theories, scraps of forbidden lore that you can use to augment your magical abilities. At 2nd level, you gain two esoteric theories of your choice. Your theory options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain apothecary levels, you gain additional theories of your choice, as shown in the Theories Known column of the Apothecary table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the theories you know and replace it with another theory that you could learn at that level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead. Greater Formula At 11th level, you discover a magical secret called a Greater Formula . Choose one 6th-level spell from the apothecary spell list as this formula. You can cast your Greater Formula once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more apothecary spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You learn an additional 6th level spell at 19th level, and an additional 7th level spell at 20th level. You regain all uses when you finish a long rest. Master Reformulation. Whenever you finish a long rest and consult your formula book, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level from the Apothecary spell list. Miraculous Recovery At 20th level, you can spend 5 minutes channeling power into a number of creatures (which can include yourself) equal to your Intelligence modifier to facilitate an abnormally fast recovery. You must tend to the creatures during this period, using a Healer's Kit with at least one use remaining. The targets regain hit points, spell slots, hit dice, and other abilities as if they completed a long rest. A creature can only benefit from one Miraculous Recovery in a 24-hour period. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Optional Rule: Multiclassing If you allow characters to use the Multiclassing optional rules, here are the requirements for multiclassing with the Apothecary Ability Score Minimum. Multiclass characters must meet ability score prerequisites for both their current class(es) and their new one. Taking multiclass levels as an Apothecary requires an Intelligence score of 13 or higher. Proficiencies. If apothecary isn't your initial class, when you take your first level as an apothecary you gain proficiency in light armor and one tool proficiency of your choice. Apothecary Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Apothecary Magic class feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Apothecary Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast apothecary spells you know. Esoteric Theories. Meeting the prerequisites for Esoteric Theories is based on total apothecary levels, not the overall character level. In addition, the Surgical Strikes esoteric theory does not give you additional attacks if you have the Extra Attack class feature. Apothecary Esoteric Theories Apothecaries develop esoteric theories during their adventures and experiments, representing their own unique synthesis of medical and occult practices. The description of each esoteric theory details the benefits you gain from selecting that theory. Some esoteric theories specify a minimum apothecary level. You can't learn such an esoteric theory until you are at least that level. Unless an esoteric theory's description says otherwise, you can't learn an esoteric theory more than once. Acquired Tolerance You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you gain resistance to poison damage. In addition, you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own apothecary spells, and never take damage from your own apothecary spells. Adrenaline Surge Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary A creature at 0 hit points who regains hit points from a spell you cast using an apothecary spell slot gains resistance to all damage and has advantage on saving throws until the end of its next turn. It gains advantage on the first attack roll it makes on its next turn. Anatomical Precision When you make a weapon attack, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. Anesthesiology Prerequisites: 14th-level apothecary You can cast Hold Person without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this theory on the same creature again. Bedside Manner You gain proficiency in the Insight and Persuasion skills. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of these skills. Caustic Formulae Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with an apothecary spell, you can expend an apothecary spell slot to deal 2d4 extra acid damage to that target, plus another 2d4 per level of the spell slot. Clinical Conditioning Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws. Combat Medic You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields. Corrosive Compound Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary When you deal poison damage with your apothecary spells, you can choose to deal half the spell's damage as poison damage and half the spell's damage as acid damage instead. Cosmetic Surgery You can spend 8 hours performing an occult surgical procedure upon a willing creature, permanently transforming its appearance. You decide what the creature looks like, including facial features, the sound of its voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, but none of its game statistics change. You can't alter the size of a creature, and its basic shape stays the same. The resulting transformation is non-magical, however, a Greater Restoration spell or similar magic cast upon the creature can restore it to its original appearance. Critical Condition Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary When a creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw made against one of your apothecary spells that deals damage, roll all of the spell's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal to determine the damage that creature takes from the spell. Diagnosis You can take the Help action as a bonus action on your turn. Doctor's Note Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary You can cast the Sending spell at-will. You must finish a long rest before you can use this theory to contact the same creature again. Double Dose Prerequisites: 10th-level apothecary When you cast an apothecary spell using an apothecary spell slot that targets a single creature and restores hit points to that creature, you can target an additional creature within range. Extracurricular Research You learn two additional cantrips of your choice from any class's spell list. These cantrips become apothecary cantrips for you. Inoculation You have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. In addition, you are immune to diseases. Interdisciplinary Practice Prerequisites: 14th-level apothecary When you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Laboratory Assistant You learn the spell Find Familiar , and always have this spell prepared. It doesn't count against the number of apothecary spells you can prepare. Liability Insurance Prerequisites: 14th-level apothecary You can cast Contingency once on yourself without material components. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Medical Expertise You gain proficiency in the Medicine and Nature skills. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of these skills.

Nerve Agent Prerequisites: 14th-level apothecary When you deal poison damage with your apothecary spells, you can choose to deal psychic damage instead.

Pharmacology When you cast a spell using an apothecary spell slot or your Greater Formula feature which restores hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier. Physiological Analysis If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its physiology. The Game Master reveals to you two of the following characteristics of your choice: Any one ability score Armor Class Current hit points Resistances (if any) Immunities (if any) Vulnerabilities (if any) Alternatively, you can spend 1 minute observing a corpse. After 1 minute, you determine the cause of death. Practical Resuscitation Prerequisites: 10th-level apothecary When you cast a spell that has the sole effect of restoring a creature to life (but not undeath), such as Raise Dead , you don't need material components to cast the spell if the creature has died within the past hour. Putrefaction Your apothecary spells and abilities ignore undead creatures' resistance or immunity to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. Rapid Response When you cast an apothecary spell that restores hit points to a creature, before or after casting the spell, you can move your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Routine Procedure Prerequisites: 10th-level apothecary You can cast Lesser Restoration at-will without expending a spell slot. Stolen Secrets Prerequisites: 10th-level apothecary You learn one spell from any class's spell list. It must be of a level for which you have apothecary spell slots or lower. The spell is treated as an apothecary spell for you, and doesn't count against the number of apothecary spells you know. Subject Preparation Prerequisites: 10th-level apothecary When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against an apothecary spell you cast before the end of your next turn. Surgeon's Instinct You have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. Surgical Strikes Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. Toxicology Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary You add your Intelligence modifier to the damage rolls of spells that deal poison damage. Triage You learn the Spare the Dying cantrip if you don't know it already. When you cast this cantrip, it has a range of 60 feet. Unfailing Focus Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary When you fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on an apothecary spell, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Venomous Instruments Prerequisites: 10th-level apothecary When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes extra poison damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. Virulence When you roll a 1 on a damage die for an apothecary spell that deals poison damage, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if the new roll is a 1. Vital Signs When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw or death saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the creature's roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. You must finish a short rest before you can use this theory on the same creature again. Vivisection Prerequisites: 6th-level apothecary Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Apothecary Spell List Below is the list of spells you consult when you learn an apothecary spell. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag (r) appears after the spell's name. Each spell is in the Fifth Edition core rules, unless it has one asterisk, which indicates that it is a new spell described in Chapter 4 of this book. Apothecaries may also learn any Contaminated Spell, a new type of spell found in chapter 4 of this book. Contaminated Spells are available to apothecaries only if found during their adventures, and cannot be chosen normally.

        "name": "Artificer",
        "description": "Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist’s supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher’s supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally’s armor, or tinker’s tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents. Arcane Science In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron’s most miraculous projects to continue. During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by their creations. Seekers of New Lore Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh, rather than iterating on familiar designs. This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron’s main travel routes and populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research. Artificers in Other Worlds Eberron is the world most associated with artificers, yet the class can be found throughout the D&D multiverse. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the World of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational. In the City of Sigil, artificers share discoveries from throughout the cosmos, and one in particular—the gnome inventor Vi—has run a multiverse-spanning business from there since leaving the world of her birth, Eberron. In the world-city Ravnica, the Izzet League trains numerous artificers, the destructiveness of whom is unparalleled in other worlds—except, perhaps, by the tinker gnomes of Krynn. The Magic of Artifice As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray , you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special. The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal , you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy. Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters. Creating an Artificer When creating an artificer, think about your character’s relationship with the artisan who taught them their craft. Does the character have a rival? Talk to your DM about the role played by artificers in the campaign and the sort of organizations you might have ties to. Quick Build You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background. Optional Rule: Multiclassing If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook , here’s what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer. Proficiencies Gained. If artificer isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools. Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. Class Features As an artificer, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per artificer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artificer level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, one type of artisan’s tools of your choice Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Sleight of Hand Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: any two simple weapons of your choice a light crossbow and 20 bolts your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment. Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency The secrets of creating and operating gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies. Spellcasting You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions. Tools Required You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an 'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook for descriptions of these tools. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus. Cantrips (0-Level Spells) At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Infuse Item At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items. Infusions Known When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one. Infusing an Item Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide ). Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one. You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies. If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding , its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space. Artificer Specialist At 3rd level, you choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed at the end of the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level. The Right Tool for the Job At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Tool Expertise Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. Flash of Genius Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Magic Item Adept When you reach 10th level, you achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items: You can attune to up to four magic items at once. If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold. Spell-Storing Item At 11th level, you learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared). While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object. Magic Item Savant At 14th level, your skill with magic items deepens more: You can attune to up to five magic items at once. You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item. Magic Item Master Starting at 18th level, you can attune to up to six magic items at once. Soul of Artifice At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection: You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to. If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0. Artificer Specialists Artificers pursue many dis ciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level. Alchemist Artillerist Battle Smith Tasha's Cauldron of Everything Armorer",

        "description": "Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer. The gnome artificer Vi and her cockatrice-like Eldritch Cannon battle foes atop a lightning train. Artificers in Many Worlds Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations. In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragon≠lance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational. Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers. Creating an Artificer Artificers invent cutting-edge problems, then try to solve them—loudly and often with collateral damage. Tasha To create an artificer, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Artificer table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear in the \"Artificer Features\" section. Multiclassing and the Artificer If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook , here’s what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum . As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer. Proficiencies Gained . If artificer isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools. Spell Slots . Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. The Magic of Artifice As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool. For example, if you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same either way. Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters. Quick Build You can make an artificer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the guild artisan background.

If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the Dungeon Master's Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them. Starting Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: any two simple weapons of your choice a light crossbow and 20 bolts your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment. Class Features As an artificer, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Artificer table. Magical Tinkering 1st-level artificer feature You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies. Spellcasting 1st-level artificer feature You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions. Tools Required You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an \"M\" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus. Cantrips (0-Level Spells) You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Artificer Spell List Here's the list of spells you consult when you learn an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell's name. Each spell is in the Player's Handbook , unless it has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two asterisks (a spell in Xanathar's Guide to Everything ). Cantrips (0 Level) Acid splash Booming blade* Create bonfire** Dancing lights Fire bolt Frostbite** Green-flame blade* Guidance Light Lightning lure* Mage hand Magic stone** Mending Message Poison spray Prestidigitation Ray of frost Resistance Shocking grasp Spare the dying Sword burst* Thorn whip Thunderclap** 1st Level Absorb elements** Alarm (ritual) Catapult** Cure wounds Detect magic (ritual) Disguise self Expeditious retreat Faerie fire False life Feather fall Grease Identify (ritual) Jump Longstrider Purify food and drink (ritual) Sanctuary Snare** Tasha’s caustic brew* 2nd Level Aid Alter self Arcane lock Blur Continual flame Darkvision Enhance ability Enlarge/reduce Heat metal Invisibility Lesser restoration Levitate Magic mouth (ritual) Magic weapon Protection from poison Pyrotechnics** Rope trick See invisibility Skywrite** (ritual) Spider climb Web 3rd Level Blink Catnap** Create food and water Dispel magic Elemental weapon Flame arrows** Fly Glyph of warding Haste Intellect fortress* Protection from energy Revivify Tiny servant** Water breathing (ritual) Water walk (ritual) 4th Level Arcane eye Elemental bane** Fabricate Freedom of movement Leomund’s secret chest Mordenkainen’s faithful hound Mordenkainen’s private sanctum Otiluke’s resilient sphere Stone shape Stoneskin Summon construct* 5th Level Animate objects Bigby’s hand Creation Greater restoration Skill empowerment** Transmute rock** Wall of stone Infuse Item 2nd-level artificer feature You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items. Infusions Known When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the \" Artificer Infusions \" section at the end of the class's description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one. Infusing an Item Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide ). Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion. You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies. If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding , its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space. Artificer Specialist 3rd-level artificer feature Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed after the class's description. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level. The Right Tool for the Job 3rd-level artificer feature You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again. Ability Score Improvement 4th-level artificer feature When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Tool Expertise 6th-level artificer feature Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. Flash of Genius 7th-level artificer feature You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Magic Item Adept 10th-level artificer feature You've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items: You can attune to up to four magic items at once. If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold. Spell-Storing Item 11th-level artificer feature You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared). While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object. Magic Item Savant 14th-level artificer feature Your skill with magic items deepens: You can attune to up to five magic items at once. You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item. Magic Item Master 18th-level artificer feature You can now attune to up to six magic items at once. Soul of Artifice 20th-level artificer feature You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection: You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to. If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0. Artificer Specialists Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level. Alchemist Armorer Artillerist Battle Smith",

        "description": "As if idly pondering where to hang the self-portrait he was holding, Menico Ghini looked around his new home. The house was a definite improvement on the one he had left behind in Torino just a few days ago, and a huge step up from the one he had grown up in all those decades ago. He had done well, all things considered, slowly but steadily accumuLating some modest wealth over the long years in which he had honed and practiced his craft. He knew how to paint in a way that was popular with men of means, and with their wives and mistresses, but not too singularly in one recognizable style. Being recognizable in his work was not something he wanted, and it was also the reason why he kept subtly changing his way of painting. He did not want to be thought an imitator of his own work from long ago – precisely because it was long ago that he sold his first painting. Too long for him to be the person that painted it and still seem to be in his early thirties. He sighed and took one last look at the self-portrait showing the features of an old, wasted man before he wrapped it up again and put it back in its padlocked chest. The Renaissance is a time of explosive developments in the arts, and Possibility is strengthened by it. Every artist creates by using colors, shapes or sounds to change the world. Imagine a stone, the epitome of Permanence! A talented sculptor can transform it into something completely different and enthrall those who see the piece. As John D. Sinclair, the translator and commentator of the Divina Commedia put it: “The true artist serves an end beyond himself in which his work has its place and value and in which he must be content to be surpassed.” Such artists are not just talented artisans, but – like the philosophers – true polymaths who excel in different fields of the arts based on a profound general education. Even more than that: due to your profound enlightenment, you work true magic through your manipulation of the cosmic forces Permanence and Possibility, like those rare geniuses Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo Buonarotti. Upbringing and career: From early youth onwards, you have studied with one of the renowned masters of the time, assisting them in their work and later taking over responsibility for entire projects. The members of this workshop have therefore been your family until you founded your own. You are versed in painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture and most likely also woodcutting. One of these fields will be your specialty, and you might even neglect the other arts. The legendary Michelangelo Buonarotti, who was commissioned to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, actually always saw himself as a sculptor and loathed having to spend years of his life painting – even if it was in the Vatican. Apart from your art, you also have a well-founded basic knowledge in history and the liberal arts. Your works are, after all, full of allegories, references and interpretations of the most important writings of both the present time and of the classical era. You have probably worked for many important families, the Church or even the rulers of a state. Artist Powers The artist has access to various unique powers. Some are Starting Powers, automatically gained at character creation, and others are Advanced Powers, gained as she progresses in levels. Consult the Artist Table to see which power is learned at which level, and how many total Weave Points she has at any given point.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per artist level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per artist level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: light armor Weapons: simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapier, shortswords Tools: Portable painting, drawing and / or whittling kit Saving Throws: Dexterity, Wisdom Skills: You need to pick Fine Arts and can choose two additional from Artes Liberales, Courtly Manners, History, Insight, Perception, Persuasion and Religion. Spell Save DC: 8 + Your proficiency bonus + Your Dexterity modifier Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a simple weapon, (b) a hand crossbow or (c) a rapier (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack Leather armor and a dagger 20 medium sized sheets of paper, canvas and a wooden frame a lamp, a flask of oil, a jug or pitcher Starting Powers: Weave Points, Likeness, The Artist’s Eye, The Artist’s Hand, The Artist’s Heart, The Artist’s Favor Advanced Powers: Perfect Recall, Perfect Judge, Phantom Confessor, It Has Always Been So, Superior Recall, Phantom Mentor, Witness, Spell Locket, Things Might Be Different, Superior Likeness, Homecoming, The Secret Garden, Artist’s Homunculus, Dorianus Griseus, Pygmalion’s Folly Starting Powers Weave Points You can use Weave Points to manipulate the forces of Possibility and Permanence and power a variety of abilities. Refer to the Artist Table for the points gained at various levels. Weave Points are either spent immediately upon use of a power, or invested into a power that is either set to be triggered at some later point or is continuous until purposely ended. Invested points can not be regained until the power they are invested in has been used or ended. Once the prepared power has been used, the invested Weave Points can be regained during the next long rest as normal. Likeness Cost: 1 Weave Point (invested) Most artist features involve the creation of a Likeness, which is a depiction of a creature or place which is then imbued with an invested Weave Point to prime it for other features to be used on it. This is the basic requirement for most higher level artist features and is accomplished with the Artist’s Hand feature (see below). It is possible to create a depiction and only later invest it with a Weave Point to prime it for the use of other features. The Artist’s Eye The artist’s powers of observation become so uncanny over time that it takes less and less time to notice an ever greater wealth of detail. You can thoroughly memorize a person or object or entire landscape to a sufficient degree that you can make a Likeness in an astonishingly short time. To see how long you need to fully take in your surroundings, subtract the artist’s proficiency bonus from 3 minutes. Once you get to less than a minute, subtract the surplus proficiency bonus from 10 Combat Rounds. Your memory remains perfect for a number of days equivalent to your proficiency bonus. Once your memory has begun to fade, you will need to make use of the advanced power Perfect Recall (see below) to refresh it. The Artist’s Hand The artist becomes ever faster at drawing, painting or sculpting. While at first level he must labor over a painting for some time, at high levels his ability to make something come to life at a rapid pace seems almost supernatural. To see how long it takes to create a useable Likeness, subtract the artist’s proficiency bonus from 5 minutes. Once you get to less than a minute, subtract the surplus proficiency bonus from 10 Combat Rounds. The Artist’s Heart Range: self The artist can enhance a Perception or Insight check with Weave Points on a one-for-one basis up to the level of his proficiency bonus. The Artist’s Favor Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Duration: 1 round Cost: – You carefully craft small inert Likenesses (no invested WP) of your party members (or any other characters well-known to you) and carry them with you for unlimited use. Such a Favor Likeness can be activated by quickly sketching a small symbol on it while the target is within 30 feet. The symbol vanishes moments after use. Each Favor Likeness can depict only one person, so each round you can only have one single target. Depending on the symbol used, you can impart one of the following effects on the target until the start of your next turn: Grant the target damage resistance to one type of damage of your choice Change of damage type inflicted by the target Make a weapon held by the target briefly magical Advanced Powers Perfect Recall Requirements: Level 1 Casting Time: 1 action Range: self Duration: instantaneous Cost: 1 WP The artist has perfect recall of any specific occurrence he or she has personally witnessed, including all senses (sound, smells, sights, touch) or any person or object he has ever seen. Perfect Judge Requirements: Level 2 Casting Time: reaction Range: 150 feet Duration: instantaneous Cost: 1 WP Using his uncanny powers of observation, the artist can predict an observed person’s next action and either impose a penalty of 1d4 on the opponent’s action or receive a bonus of 1d4 for his opposing action if appropriate.The penalty or bonus becomes 1d6 at level 5, 1d8 at level 10 and 1d10 at level 15. Phantom Confessor Requirements: Level 3 Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Duration: 10 minutes Cost: 3 WP In your mind’s eye, converse with or interrogate any one person you can see at the time: you can ask up to 3 questions. You can use Perception or Insight checks as you would in an actual conversation. If you have at hand a Likeness instead of the actual person, you can have this conversation with the depicted Likeness of that person. The avatar will respond as the actual person would, so is able to dissemble or lie. The avatar can’t refuse to interact, however. The target is not aware of the use of this feature. It Has Always Been So Requirements: Level 5 Casting Time: 1 action Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 4 WP Imbue a Likeness of a place you have made with additional Weave Points to alter that place. For example, when in a prison cell, the artist could draw that cell with its door open. Upon expenditure of the Weave Points the change will become manifested (in this example, the door will open), and the Likeness will be destroyed. A painting of a river could establish a bridge in reality if the artist adds it in the Likeness. The change in reality will remain until the artist’s next short or long rest. Superior Recall Requirements: Level 6 Casting Time: 1 action Range: self Duration: concentration (up tp 10 minutes) Cost: 2 WP As Perfect Recall, but the artist can witness the scene from any point within 20 feet of his or her actual position at the time. As even a second ago is the past, it is effectively possible to do this practically in real time. You can’t take any action at all while using this feature. And no, the artist can’t stay in the remembered scene past the point he originally witnessed. Phantom Mentor Requirements: Level 7 Casting Time: 10 minute ritual Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 2 WP per Ability Contest Influence a person you have faithfully depicted in a Likeness through a diligent process of influence through conversation. Suggestions, threats or observations you make towards the depiction of your target (the avatar) will gradually have an effect on the real person. The target will be unable to explain how the changes in his or her thinking or emotional state came about, but will somehow rationalize the change. The artist and the target engage in one single Charisma (Persuasion) contest per day, and each time the artist wins the target’s mind is changed in a small way determined by the GM. Witness Requirements: Level 9 Casting Time: 1 action Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 1 WP per minute for 1 sense in your mind’s eye, 1 WP for each additional sense for the entire duration, 1 WP to let others witness with you for the entire duration. By concentrating on a Likeness you have created you can observe the depicted place or person, allowing you to spy on it. The cost depends on the number of senses involved and whether you observe the target in your mind’s eye only or make its actions visible for others observing the likeness with you. Spell Locket Requirements: Level 10 Casting Time: 10 minute ritual Range: touch Duration: unlimited Cost: 1 WP (invested) per level of the spell slot Create an object that will store a spell effect for one use. Any spell caster can cast that spell for the artist. The artist must decide on a spell slot level when creating the object and must be present when a spell is loaded into that slot by a spellcaster (who must actually expend that spell). It is possible to create an object with a certain level spell slot and then at some later date load it with any spell of that or lesser level (but still only one single spell per object). Use of the spell destroys the object (it will crumble). Only the artist can trigger the spell. Things Might Be Different Requirements: Level 11 Casting Time: 1 minute ritual Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 3 WP initially, then 2WP per day Imbue a Likeness you have created with Weave Points to incrementally alter reality. For example, a depiction of a lowly person as a person of wealth and power will result in a trickle of good fortune towards that person until he or she has achieved the depicted state. This requires a steady expenditure of 1 Weave Point per day. If the expenditure of Weave Points ist ever halted, the effect ends, the scales of fate right themselves again, and the person is again master of their own luck. Whether they can hold on to their new status or wealth is up to them now. The feature can’t alter a person in any way that would normally require a level increase (so, no Ability increases, for example). It is possible to influence matters of fate surrounding the target, so changes in wealth, luck and public perception are possible. For double the daily Weave Point cost (4 WP), positive changes in mental and physical health are possible. Dismay points can be erased at a rate of 1 per 3 days, or you can completely cure a disease over the course of one week, or heal 2d6 hit points per day (at level 11 3d6, at level 15 4d6). It is not possible to reverse aging with this power. Superior Likeness Requirements: Level 13 Casting Time: 1 action Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 3 WP (invested) Upgrade a Likeness you made with additional Weave Points to enable it to transfer the effects of spells to the target. A magic-user targets the Likeness as if it were the depicted person or object iteself, and the depicted person or object suffers the spell’s effects. Each use of a spell on the target may destroy the Superior Likeness: if the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw after the spell has been transferred (this is separate from any saves versus the spell’s effects), the Superior Likeness is destroyed. Homecoming Requirements: Level 14 Casting Time: special Range: touch (the Likeness)/unlimited Duration: special Cost: 2 WP (invested), 1 WP tp transfer Paint a room you are intimately familiar with, such as your own study, and imbue this Likeness with (invested) Weave Points The process of enabling the Likeness to allow Homecoming takes 1 minute – making it ready for imminent use then requires a short preparation that takes only 1 action. You can then travel instantly to the depicted room whenever you wish with the expenditure of 1 Weave Point in the course of 1 action. The act of doing so destroys the painting a few moments after the transition is complete, and the invested Weave Points can be regained with the next long rest. To accommodate the transfer of additional people with the artist, an additional 1 Weave Point per person other than the artist must be spent as each of them goes through. In this case, the artist goes through last, triggering the end of the effect. Each person going through needs to spend 1 action. The painting has to be large enough to at least reach through with one hand. The Secret Garden Requirements: Level 15 Casting Time: 1 action Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 2 WP (invested) Create a Likeness of an imaginary place, usually a room with a shelf, and imbue it with 2 invested Weave Points. You may then transfer objects into that place and retrieve them whenever you wish. Each object stored requires an expenditure of an additional invested 1 Weave Point above the creation cost. This invested Weave Point is regained at the next long rest after the object is retrieved from the Secret Garden. Artist’s Homunculus Requirements: Level 17 Casting Time: 1 hour ritual Range: touch (the Likeness)Duration: permanent Cost: 10 WP + 1 WP (invested) for compliance (optional) Imbue a Likeness of a person with a semblance of life. If in a painting, the depiction will become animated like an actual person, can move about in the background of the painting (or drawing) and can speak with the artist. By investing one additional Weave Point while creating the image, it can be made more compliant, otherwise it will have free will. It is possible to use this feature on a sculpture but it will not be able to move about; instead, it will mostly retain its pose except for the animation of its facial features and the ability to turn its head or move its arms. A bust is of course also an option. The personality and knowledge of the homunculus depend on the creation process, and also whether it is a depiction of a real person or wholly imaginary.The homunculus receives 12 skill points in total which can be assigned to any skill or skills of the artist’s choosing – one skill with a rating of 12 is possible, as are 12 skills with a rating of 1 each, or anything in between. When the homunculus makes a skill check, it rolls a d20 + skill rating. The point distribution is decided upon creation of the homunculus and cannot be altered later on.The artist can only have one homunculus at any given time. And do remember that the creation of a Likeness requires investment of 1 Weave Point to begin with. Dorianus Griseus Requirements: Level 18 Casting Time: 1 day ritual Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: permanent Cost: 20 WP to create + 4 WP (invested) Create a lifelike self-portrait (drawing, painting or sculpture) which can then draw negative effects into itself from the artist. Half of any damage (no matter what kind, even aging effects) inflicted upon the artist will instead be transferred to the artist’s likeness in the painting, no matter how far artist and painting are separated. That likeness can accumulate age and damage indefinitely. If the artwork is ever destroyed, the artist immediately suffers the following consequences: 1d6 damage for every full 10 years of the artwork’s existence, incapacitated for 1d6 minutes, immediately (in a matter of minutes) age half as many years as the artwork has existed. The artist can only have one such object at any time. Pygmalion’s Folly Requirements: Level 20 Casting Time: 1 action Range: touch (the Likeness) Duration: special Cost: 20 WP to create + 2 WP (invested) Imbue a perfect Likeness of a humanoid or animal with actual life. A painted creature will come to life inside the environment depicted in the painting and can exit from there into the real world if the artist possesses the Homecoming feature to facilitate this. A sculpture will simply come to life as a real person indistinguishable from a real human being. If the person is a true depiction of an existing person, it will think itself that person if you invest an extra 1 Weave Point during the process of creation. Otherwise the newly created person will be of a childlike disposition, but mature rapidly.

        "name": "Barbarian",
        "description": "A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges⁠ toward the frost giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd. A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals. Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another. These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength. Primal Instinct People of towns and cities⁠ take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt. Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat⁠. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman stre⁠ngth and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting⁠, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise. A Life of Danger Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled⁠ fighter⁠ in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring⁠ parties. Creating a Barbarian When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common? What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority. Quick Build You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d12 per barbarian level Hit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light⁠ armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons⁠ Tools: None Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a greataxe or ( b ) any martial melee weapon ( a ) two handaxes or ( b ) any simple weapon An explorer’s pack and four javelins Rage In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor: You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. Unarmored Defense While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor⁠ Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. Reckless Att⁠ack Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to a⁠ttack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon a⁠ttack rolls using Strength during this turn, but atta⁠ck rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. Danger Sense At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. Primal Path At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Fast Movement⁠ Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. Feral Instinct By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. Brutal Critical Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. Relentless⁠ Rage Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. Persistent Rage Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. Indomitable Might Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. Primal Champion⁠ At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. Primal Paths Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.

Primal Champion At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. Primal Paths Path of the Berserker For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. Frenzy Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in Conditions ). Mindless Rage Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging . If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. Intimidating Presence Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier ) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn . On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. Retaliation Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.",

More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil. Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses. Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . While active, your Rage follows the rules below. Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning , Piercing , and Slashing damage. Rage Damage.

Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws . No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain Concentration , and you can’t cast spells. Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following: Make an attack roll against an enemy. Force an enemy to make a saving throw. Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage. Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes. Level 1: Unarmored Defense While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers . You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit. Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes . Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices. When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.

You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition. Level 2: Reckless Attack You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time. Level 3: Barbarian Subclass You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The Path of the Berserker , Path of the Wild Heart , Path of the World Tree , and Path of the Zealot subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower. Level 3: Primal Knowledge You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1. In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics , Intimidation , Perception , Stealth , or Survival . When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 5: Fast Movement Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. Level 7: Feral Instinct Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls. Level 7: Instinctive Pounce As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage , you can move up to half your Speed . Level 9: Brutal Strike If you use Reckless Attack , you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength -based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have Disadvantage .

You have the following effect options. Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks. Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one. Level 11: Relentless Rage Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw . If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest , the DC resets to 10. Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options. Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn. Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus. Level 15: Persistent Rage When you roll Initiative , you can regain all expended uses of Rage . After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor. Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature. Level 18: Indomitable Might If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score , you can use that score in place of the total. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.

        "description": "Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts. A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting⁠ the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism⁠. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them. Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions’ words will be well received. Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. Music and Magic In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech⁠, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial⁠ Words of Creation⁠ still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers. The greatest stre⁠ngth of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat⁠, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells⁠. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge. Learning from Experience True bards are not common⁠ in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer⁠. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows. Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves. Creating a Bard Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood⁠. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood⁠ might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspi⁠ration of fey or other supernatural creatures. Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list. Cantrips You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. Spell Slots The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds ⁠ using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells⁠ of your choice. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting⁠ Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Ritual Casting You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. Spellcasting⁠ Focus You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equip­ment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. Bardic Insp⁠i⁠ration You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Insp⁠ira⁠tion die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Insp⁠iration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiratio⁠n die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspir⁠ation die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspira⁠tion die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. Jack of All Trades Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus. Song of Rest Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. Bard College At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. Expertise At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Font of Inspir⁠ation Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspirati⁠on when you finish a short or long rest. Countercharm At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). Magical Secrets By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells⁠ for you and are included in the number in the Spells⁠ Known column of the Bard table. You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level. Superior Insp⁠iration At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspi⁠ration left, you regain one use. Bard Colleges The way of the bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.

The Inspirations of Adventure Rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves. Creating a Bard What's the story of your past? Were you an apprentice, following another bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced musical magic? Perhaps you were a runaway or an orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?

College of Lore Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage . The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed . Additional Magical Secrets At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast , as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip . The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know. Peerless Skill Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check , you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration . Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.",

        "description": "An Inspiring Performer of Music, Dance, and Magic Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language. Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests. A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer.

This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6. Using Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action , you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test , the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled. Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15. Level 1: Spellcasting You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery are recommended. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list . When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list , as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table . Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list . Charm Person , Color Spray , Dissonant Whispers , and Healing Word are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table . Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard , your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells. Level 2: Expertise You gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them. At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Level 2: Jack of All Trades You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus . For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check. Level 3: Bard Subclass You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Dance , College of Glamour , College of Lore , and College of Valor subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower. A Bard’s Repertoire Does your Bard beat a drum while chanting the deeds of ancient heroes? Strum a lute while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose naughty limericks? When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or strive to master them all? Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Font of Inspiration You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest . In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration . Level 7: Countercharm You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage . Level 10: Magical Secrets You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard , Cleric , Druid , and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists. Level 18: Superior Inspiration When you roll Initiative , you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended. Level 20: Words of Creation You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target. Bard Spell List This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6. Using Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled. Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15. Level 1: Spellcasting You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious Mockery are recommended. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list. When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table. Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person , Color Spray , Dissonant Whispers , and Healing Word are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells. Level 2: Expertise You gain Expertise (see the rules glossary) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them. At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Level 2: Jack of All Trades You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus. For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check. Level 3: Bard Subclass You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College of Dance, College of Glamour, College of Lore, and College of Valor subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower. A Bard’s Repertoire Does your Bard beat a drum while chanting the deeds of ancient heroes? Strum a lute while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose naughty limericks? When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or strive to master them all? Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Font of Inspiration You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest. In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration. Level 7: Countercharm You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage. Level 10: Magical Secrets You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists. Level 18: Superior Inspiration When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended. Level 20: Words of Creation You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target. Bard Spell List This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, C means the spell requires Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a specific Material component.

        "name": "Beastheart",
        "description": "Erupting out of the sand on the back of a bulette, a half-orc leaps into the air. They cleave a path through armored skeletons with a greatsword while their mount charges in the opposite direction, leaving a cloud of powdered bone in their wake. A halfling flies over a burning forest on the back of a baby green dragon. The wyrmling sniffs the air and cries out, pointing with a claw to indicate a safe path to lead fearful forest creatures through the conflagration. Sneaking upside down next to their giant spider companion, a half-elf’s web-covered feet keep them securely attached to a cavern ceiling. The bandits below have no idea that their camp has been infiltrated, and that their days of attacking local settlements are at an end. A beastheart is an adventurer who forms a bond of friendship with a wild creature, and who draws power from that bond as it strengthens over time. Working as a team, a beastheart and their faithful companion can take on even the most dangerous adventures, challenging any monsters and overcoming any obstacles. Supernatural Bond The connection a beastheart and a companion share isn’t just one of love and admiration. It’s a mystical bond that allows the beastheart to harness their companion’s fury, might, and instincts for survival. When their companion is enraged, a beastheart channels that ferocity into supernatural deeds of martial prowess. In return, the wild companion can harness the beastheart’s focus and direction. This supernatural kinship can form over a long period of time. Some beasthearts bond with unorthodox pets or wild protectors as children, becoming ever closer as both grow up together. Other beasthearts come of age in the wilderness, raised among wild creatures—or even raised by them—as a means of learning to respect and embrace the might of nature. But the beastheart bond can also form more quickly, typically in times of great duress. A person lost and starving in the wild might become a beastheart when they connect with a creature that saves their life by providing food and shelter. Or a wild creature injured and beset by poachers can befriend a character who saves their life, with the creature’s gratitude forging the beastheart bond. Not every person is cut out to become a beastheart, just as not every animal is meant to be a companion. The pair must share an innate wildness and an unwavering trust in order to form this rare fellowship. Companions, Not Pets Most beasthearts have no desire to fully tame their wild friends, for doing so would rob beloved companions of their personalities and fighting spirit. Instead, a beastheart views themself as a caregiver, looking after a companion whose heart is as fierce and open as their own. The companion shares a similar view, thinking of their beastheart as a member of the pack, and treating a caregiver as a sibling always ready to explore, hunt, and play. Wild at Heart To an outsider, a beastheart and a companion might appear to be equals. (The companion most likely feels that way!) But the beastheart is always aware that their companion is a force of nature, not a domesticated creature. As such, a beastheart accepts that their companion might not be capable of deep introspection, as most companions live for the moment, dwell not on the past, and give little thought to the future. It’s thus the beastheart’s responsibility to do those things for themself and their wild friend, taking responsibility for a companion as a parent might care for a child, and grieving if the wild heart they’ve cared for is ever stilled. Untamed Pair Like the companions who stalk and explore at their sides, beasthearts bear a wondrous connection to the natural world, allowing them to track prey, survive in harsh environments, and get along even with wild creatures that aren’t their companions. Many beasthearts are most at home in the wilderness, sleeping under the stars and enjoying the bounty of nature. Even when beasthearts and their companions make their lives in towns or cities, the untamed wilds beyond a settlement or the endless depths beneath it are often on their minds, constantly calling them to adventure. Creating a Beastheart As you create your beastheart character, consider the history of your friendship with your companion. Did you find the creature as a child and grow up together? Or did you form a bond with them only recently? Is this the first companion you’ve had, and are you the first person to whom your companion has bonded in this way? Think about the moment you became friends and the trials you’ve already faced. You might have survived in the wilderness together while one of you was injured. You might have saved your companion from trophy hunters. Or your companion might have instead saved your life by fighting off a deadly enemy. Consider your companion’s personality and tastes. Are they rambunctious or lazy? Standoffish or friendly? What tricks can you perform together? What is your companion’s favorite food? You should also think about how your companion and you complement each other in looks or personality. Does your appearance reflect or contrast theirs? What activities do you both enjoy? How do you communicate with your companion? And how do you encourage others to communicate with and show respect for your friend? Quick Build You can make a beastheart quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score (or Strength if you want to use a melee weapon), followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the outlander background. Beastheart Inspiration Heroes who undertake great adventures with loyal creatures at their sides are a mainstay of stories and folk tales from countless cultures, with many of those older tales inspiring the fantasy novels and films of the modern age. Inspirations for for the beastheart include How to Train Your Dragon , His Dark Materials , Race the Sands , and Phoenix Extravagant just to name a few. In many of those stories, the heroes can not only communicate with their companion creatures, but share connections to those friends that grant them supernatural powers or incredible physical talents. It’s these sorts of connections that inspire the features of the beastheart class, making a beastheart and their companion much more powerful in tandem than either would be while adventuring alone. Multiclassing and the Beastheart If your group uses the optional rule for multiclassing, here’s what you need to know if you choose beastheart as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength or Dexterity score of 13 and a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a beastheart. Proficiencies Gained. If beastheart isn’t your initial class, you gain no new proficiencies when you take your first level as a beastheart. Multiclassing Options Players in campaigns using the optional multiclassing rules might be tempted to take one level in the beastheart class simply to gain a companion, since the companion’s hit points and ferocity actions improve as the character advances in any class (not just in the beastheart class). However, you’re actually better off asking your GM for a companion creature and advancing in your current class, since a single level in the beastheart class doesn’t gain you much other than the companion.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per beastheart level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per beastheart level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, battleaxes, greataxes, longbows, nets, scimitars, shortswords Tools: None Saving Throws: Strength, Wisdom Skills: Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: hide armor; or leather armor, a longbow, and 20 arrows a martial weapon and a shield; or two martial weapons two handaxes or any simple weapon a dungeoneer’s pack or an explorer’s pack Companion At 1st level, you gain a companion creature that accompanies you on your adventures, fighting, exploring, and living alongside you. You can choose any companion in this supplement or other MCDM supplements. You might also find some cool companions on the MCDM subreddit and in the MCDM Discord server . The Companions section above has information on fifteen companion creatures you can choose for your beastheart, and information on the rules for using companions (including ferocity and entering a rampage). Your supernatural connection to your companion binds their life to yours, allowing you to help your companion overcome even the most grievous injuries. If your companion has lost hit points or is dead, you can spend 1 minute meditating on your companion’s spirit. The companion then regains all their hit points and returns to life if they were dead, and you gain one level of exhaustion. If the companion’s body was destroyed, they reform within 5 feet of you. The first time you finish a long rest after you gain a level in this class, you can bond with a new companion of your choice, which arrives in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you in a manner determined by the GM. If you already have a companion from this feature, they leave to be on their own when the new companion arrives. Natural Language From 1st level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with your companion, as well as with all Beasts and Monstrosities. This feature doesn’t allow you to communicate complex thoughts or questions, but you can make simple statements (such as showing other creatures you mean them no harm) or ask simple questions (such as the location of the nearest body of water, or if a specific individual with a unique look passed through the area recently). The knowledge and awareness of such creatures is limited by their intellect, and the GM determines if a particular creature is in a communicative mood. While speaking with a Beast or Monstrosity using this feature, you can make Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks in place of Charisma checks to influence the creature. Primal Exploits Starting at 2nd level, you learn to channel your companion’s fury into extraordinary deeds called primal exploits, which are fueled by your companion’s ferocity. You learn three primal exploits of your choice, detailed below. You learn two additional exploits of your choice at 10th and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the primal exploits you know and replace it with another primal exploit, for which you must have the appropriate beastheart level. Some exploits are activated using your reaction. Others are usable under specific circumstances but require no action. Some exploits are activated as part of the Attack action, in which case, you can use only one such exploit per turn. All exploits require you to spend your companion’s ferocity to use them. Your companion must be within 60 feet of you when you use an exploit, and must have ferocity at least equal to the exploit’s cost. The companion loses ferocity equal to the cost when you use the exploit. You can use an exploit even if your companion is unconscious, as long as they have the appropriate ferocity. You can’t use an exploit while your companion has entered a rampage. Some exploits allow a companion to make a signature attack. This signature attack can’t be modified with additional exploits or used as part of a ferocity action. Exploit Save DC Some of your exploits require creatures to make a saving throw to resist the exploit’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Exploit save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Saving throws for your exploits use your exploit save DC even if the action that triggers the saving throw is undertaken by your companion. Your exploit save DC also adjusts the DC of your companion’s ferocity actions (see Improved Ferocity below).

Aid Us, Friend (3 Ferocity). You can activate this exploit whenever you take the Attack action. Before or after you attack, your companion can take the Help action as a bonus action. Bring Them Down (4 Ferocity). When your companion hits a creature with their signature attack, you can use your reaction to command the companion to yank the target down. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. Drag Them (4 Ferocity). When your companion hits a Large or smaller creature with their signature attack and both the companion and the target are standing on the ground, you can use your reaction to command your companion to move the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the companion moves up to half their walking speed in any direction you choose and pulls the target with it. Feral Reflexes (2 Ferocity). When you or your companion is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to increase the target’s AC by 2 against the triggering attack. Hurricane Blow (3 Ferocity). You can activate this exploit whenever you take the Attack action. The first time you hit a creature with a weapon attack this turn, the attack deals its normal effects, and you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you. No Escape (1+ Ferocity). At the start of your turn when your companion gains ferocity and doesn’t enter a rampage, you can spend up to your Wisdom modifier in ferocity (minimum 1; no action required). Until the start of your next turn, your speed or your companion’s speed (your choice) increases by 5 feet × the ferocity spent. Primal Pounce (3 Ferocity). When your companion hits a creature with their signature attack, you can use your reaction to command the companion to grapple the target. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the companion grabs the target and the target is grappled (escape DC equal to your exploit save DC). The grapple also ends if your companion attacks a creature other than the target. Quick Hide (2 Ferocity). You can activate this exploit whenever you take the Attack action. The first time you hit a creature with a weapon attack this turn, your companion can take the Hide action as a reaction if they are able to hide. Thrash (4 Ferocity). When your companion hits a Large or smaller creature with a melee signature attack, you can use your reaction to command the companion to thrash the target from side to side, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, and attack rolls against the target have advantage, until the start of your next turn. Primal Exploits: 10th Level You can take any of the following exploits when you gain new exploits at 10th and 17th levels. Crushing Charge (8 Ferocity). As an action, you move up to your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. You can move through other creatures’ spaces, but must end your move in an unoccupied space. Each creature in a space you move through, except for your companion, must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to 5d6. Expanding Fury (6 Ferocity). When your companion uses a ferocity action that affects creatures within a specific distance from the companion, you can use your reaction to expand that distance by 10 feet. Furious Vengeance (5 Ferocity). When a creature hits you or your companion with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 4d6 psychic damage to the attacker. When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to 5d6. Marked Prey (4 Ferocity). When your companion uses a ferocity action that requires a creature to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the save. Primal Shout (6 Ferocity). As an action, you let loose a menacing bellow. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Wrath of the Pack (4 Ferocity). When you hit a creature with an attack and that creature is within 5 feet of your companion, you can have your companion make a signature attack against the creature (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals its normal effects, and the target is knocked prone. Primal Exploits: 17th Level You can take any of the following exploits when you gain new exploits at 17th level. Blood Sport (16 Ferocity). When you hit a Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack, you can also push the target up to 30 feet away from you and knock them prone (no action required). If the target ends this move within 5 feet of your companion, the companion can make a signature attack against the target. On a hit, the attack deals its normal effects, and the target is pushed up to 30 feet away from your companion. If the target ends this move within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against them (no action required) that deals an extra 4d6 damage if it hits. Break the Earth (14 Ferocity). As an action, you open a 10-foot-radius pit in the ground, floor, or other surface within 60 feet of you. The pit can be up to 50 feet deep, depending on the depth beneath the surface where it is opened. Each creature standing in the area when the pit opens must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature falls into the pit, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen and landing prone. On a success, the creature moves to an unoccupied space of their choice at the edge of the pit. A creature can climb the rough walls of the pit without an ability check. Bury the Dead (16 Ferocity). When you and your companion are within 5 feet of a creature, you can use an action to cause a vicious whirlwind filled with debris and dirt to rise around the creature, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is restrained. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or restrained. A creature restrained this way can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your exploit save DC, freeing themself on a success. Imbue Projectile (14 Ferocity). As an action, you make a ranged weapon attack. Whether or not the attack hits, a wave of energy explodes from the weapon or ammunition used in the attack, centered on your target. Each creature within 20 feet of the target (including the target and excluding your companion) must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Rend (12 Ferocity). As an action, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and your companion. You make a melee weapon attack against the target, and your companion makes a signature attack against the target (no actions required). If you both hit and deal damage to the target, the target is knocked prone and takes an additional 6d6 damage of a type dealt by either attack (your choice). Spirit Form (14 Ferocity). As a bonus action, you make you and your companion incorporeal until the end of your next turn. While incorporeal, you each have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. While incorporeal, you and your companion each gain a flying speed equal to your individual walking speed, and each of you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Either of you takes 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object. Improved Ferocity Also at 2nd level, whenever your companion uses a ferocity action that requires a creature to make an ability check or saving throw, the companion can use your primal exploit save DC in place of the normal DC. Companion Bond At 3rd level, you choose a specialized bond that you share with your companion. Choose Ferocious Bond, Hunter Bond, Infernal Bond, Primordial Bond, or Protector Bond (all detailed below). Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Master Caregiver Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you already have proficiency in Animal Handling, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with the skill. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Beyond Instinct At 5th level, thanks to your care, your companion’s tenacity and versatility grow. You and your companion gain the following benefits: Whenever your companion gains ferocity at the start of your turn, they gain an additional 1 ferocity. Your companion gains proficiency in saving throws with one ability score of your choice. Your companion gains proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, or Survival. Your companion can use Wisdom in place of Intelligence when they make an ability check using the Investigation skill, and they can use Strength or Dexterity in place of Charisma when they make an ability check using the Intimidation or Performance skill. When you reach 10th level in this class, the additional ferocity your companion gains increases to 3. Your companion gains proficiency in another saving throw of your choice, and gains proficiency in another skill from the list above. When you reach 15th level in this class, the additional ferocity your companion gains increases to 5. Your companion gains proficiency in another saving throw of your choice, and gains proficiency in another skill from the list above. Improved Signature Attack At 5th level, when your companion hits with their signature attack, the attack deals one additional weapon damage die. This increases to two additional weapon damage dice at 11th level and three additional dice at 17th level. Additionally, damage dealt by your companion’s attacks and ferocity actions counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Faithful Companion At 6th level, your supernatural connection to your companion grows, allowing you to coordinate faster and to work better as a team with all your allies. You no longer need to use your bonus action to command your companion. Instead, as long as you are not incapacitated, you can direct them to take an action simply with verbal or physical signs that require no action. Additionally, when your companion enters a rampage when you are not incapacitated and they can see or hear you, they do not automatically move toward and attack the nearest creature.

Another duo might bond over their need to protect nature or their pack, while a different beastheart might use their companion’s rage to harness the powers of Hell.

        "description": "A hooked nose drips with a crimson sheen in the moonlight. A slit, carved into greyish-green mottled skin. Channelling his magic through his blood, the goblin twists and forms a jagged blade from his bleeding wound, smiling wide with his red, stained sharp teeth. Arms and eyes deadlocked toward an injured ally locked in combat with a competent foe. an elf begins channeling blood out of the pores in his dark calloused skin, groaning with pain, visible on his stern face. The blood flows to his companion and heals their wound, encouraging them to fight on. A long-clawed hand hovers over a gash to an ally’s arm, drawing out their blood and twisting it round their body to their other hand, melding it with a fireball to produce a Vermillion flame. The scaled arms drawback and launch the flame at a group of bandits. The resultant fire burns not only their bodies but their very life essence as well. Within In Their Veins As a Blood Mage, your power comes from not only the arcane that is intrinsically woven into the world around you but also from a vast well of energy within yourself and others. Most Blood Mages are met with scorn from outside observers but to those who study these 'Forbidden Arts' there is something liberating to be found. It can be a tool of harm and health, wielded to the content of the weaver, many use these arts for personal gain and power but there are legends of those who have rejected this trope and carved a niche as expert healers. For what better way to treat an ailment than to affect the very thing that it targets? An Alternate Power Not all mages have a natural aptitude towards the arcane in the normal, socially accepted sense. Some of those who struggle look for other ways to increase their magical prowess, often, turning to darker more forbidden arts in a bid to become the spell caster they wish to be. Of those mages, a rare few find the arcane power that lies inert within the life essence contain in blood. Desperate to continue their life as a mage, this power soon takes deep roots within them as they expand upon their newly awakened magical abilities. The only downside those who use blood magic seem to find, is that they are ill suited to fighting undead, and as such, they tend to steer clear of crypts, and tombs, preferring to stay near fresher sources of blood such as towns or cities, though they tend to not use their blood magic openly in these areas, as most people consider it an evil practice, or taboo at the least.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per Blood Mage level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 + Constitution modifier per Blood Mage level after 1st Proficiencies Armour: Light armour Weapons: Daggers, Darts, Slings, Quarterstaffs, Light Crossbows Saving Throws: Constitution and one other of your choice Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, History, Medicine, Nature or Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: a Quarterstaff (b) a Dagger Explorer's Pack or (b) Scholar's Pack Two Empty Vials A Spellbook Spellcasting The mysteries of Blood Magic are as incredible as they are terrifying. They allow a person to access overwhelming power at a terrible cost. As a purveyor of these sacrosanct arts, you focus on the ability to augment spells through the life energy of blood, or the ability to control and manipulate a creature’s blood. Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Blood Mage's spell list. You learn additional Blood Mage cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Blood Mage table. Spell Slots The Blood Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Blood Mage spells, you must expend a slot of the spells level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spells Known Of 1st Level And Higher Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the blood mage's spell list. The Spells Known Column of the blood mage table shows when you learn more blood mage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the blood mage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the blood mage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Also, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose to lower your max HP by 1d8 to learn an additional blood mage spell every level. Spells obtained in this way do not count against your spells known and cannot be replaced.\" Spellcasting Ability Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your blood mage spells. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blood mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier Spellcasting Focus A Blood Mage uses their own blood as the focus for their spells, as such, the blood mage creates an orb of blood that hovers around their body, known as an Arcane Blood Mass. Arcane Blood Mass 1st Level Feature As a bonus action you can reduce your current hit points and your hit point maximum by a number up to your blood mage level, to siphon blood out of your body, which then floats around you to become your Arcane Blood Mass, the arcane focus needed for Blood Mage exclusive Cantrips & Spells. You can only do this if the reduction does not exceed your current hit points. The reduction lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action or if you finish a short or long rest causing the mass to return to your body. If you dismiss the Mass, you regain its current HP and HP Maximum. If you fall to 0 HP whilst your Arcane Blood Mass is active, it returns to you immediately and you regain its HP, and HP Maximum. This effect also occurs if your HP Maximum falls to 0. Any damage dealt to you, that would reduce your HP or HP Maximum to below 0, is carried over after your Arcane Blood Mass returns to you. The Arcane Blood Mass can be targeted for attacks. It has an AC of 10, and its HP/HP maximum is equal to the number put into it during its creation. It has immunity to piercing damage and resistance to necrotic damage. Blood Focus 1st Level Feature You must now choose a focus for your blood magic progression. There are three Blood Mage variants detailed at the end of the class description; the Haemomancer, the Sacrificial Preserver, and the Sanguine Supplementer. Blood Analysis 2nd Level Feature You can perform a 1-minute magic ritual on a sample of blood, reading the necromantic energy trapped in blood like a book so as to learn more about the creature it belonged to. In doing so you learn the creature's type (i.e., dragon, aberration, humanoid etc.), age, sex, if it was afflicted by any maladies at the time of blood loss, and how old the blood sample itself is. If you analyse two different blood samples, you are able to tell if they belong to the same creature and when and where you have analysed the blood of the creature before. Ability Score Increase When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Thicker Than Water 5th Level Feature You have become accustomed to recovering from damage. You regain an additional 1d4 hit points for every hit die you spend at the end of a short rest. Additionally, your blood magic has become more potent, as such, blood mage spells that use your own blood are able to overcome bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, and necrotic resistances but not immunities.\" Blood Drain 6th Level Feature You learn the 3rd level spell Blood Drain, and can cast it twice per day without expending a spell slot. Additionally, whenever you use a spell that takes a creatures blood, you can learn a single fragment of information about that creature as if you had used the Blood Analysis feature. You choose which piece of information to learn: the creature's type, age, sex or if it is afflicted by any maladies. Blood Drain 3rd Level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 Action Range: 30 feet Target: One creature you can see within range Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous Classes: Blood Mage You attempt to drain the blood out of a creature within range. If the target is not willing, then they must make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is willing, they take full damage. When this spell damages a creature, the caster chooses one of the following effects: Gain HP equal to the damage the target took. As a free action, you can use the blood drained from the target to cast a Blood Mage spell, equal to or lower than the level you cast this spell. The damage taken by the target of this spell(Blood Drain) is used for any HP requirements of other spells cast using this effect, if additional HP is required on top of this, it is provided by the caster as normal. This effect cannot be used to cast Blood Drain. The drained blood morphs into a weapon of your choice. It deals necrotic damage equal to half the damage dealt with this spell + your intelligence modifier, has the properties of your chosen weapon, counts as magical, and lasts for 1 minute before turning into dust and disappearing. This spell has no effect on creatures without blood, such as Constructs, Certain Undead (ask your DM) or Machines. This spell requires an Arcane Blood Mass to cast. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d6 for each level above 3rd. Blood Pack 10th Level Feature You can now stockpile extra blood inside special vials known to blood mages as packs. These blood packs can store blood with hit points up to twice your blood mage level. If a feature or spell requires you to sacrifice HP you can use the HP from your blood packs instead. As a blood mage, you may also use these packs to heal yourself during combat, though to do so costs both your action and bonus action. You must have an empty pack vial to create a blood pack. Blood packs may only be created during a long or short rest. One blood pack holds approximately 1 pint of blood, when empty, they weigh 0.2 lb, when full they weigh 1.3lb. Bloody Resilience 20th Level Feature Your mastery of blood magic has enabled you to constantly interweave arcane forces with your own life essence, allowing you to rapidly heal wounds and clean your body of toxins, as such you gain the following benefits: You are immune to all Diseases as well as Poisons and Toxins (Poison Damage) You learn the Regenerate spell if you do not know it. You can now cast it on yourself as an action, using thought.",

        "name": "Bloodspeaker",
        "description": "Distinct among the many heretical mages, blood sorcerers, and vile arcanists of Rokugan, Bloodspeakers are trained in the forbidden arts created by Iuchiban himself. After Iuchiban opened two Black Scrolls during the sixth century and plundered the vile knowledge within to unleash a horde of undead upon Rokugan, he used the Bloodspeakers to both command his armies and infiltrate society’s highest ranks, nearly destabilizing the Emerald Empire in the process. When this insurrection was thwarted, the Bloodspeaker cults scattered. Most Bloodspeakers train within a cult that has passed down Iuchiban’s evil lore for generations. Compared to other blood sorcerers’ methods, the Words of Power wielded by Bloodspeakers, called malefic words, allow them to better hide the unholy power upon which they draw and resist the temptation to give themselves over fully to Fu Leng. Bloodspeakers deal with and control corrupted spirits and undead beings, similar to the blood magic practitioners who serve Fu Leng. However, the Bloodspeakers’ art lets them avoid becoming one of the Lost or otherwise suffering the corruption of the Shadowlands. It does this primarily by siphoning any corruption off into the land or into other creatures. The fact that Bloodspeakers use true names to command evil spirits without needing to use their own blood as an offering also helps them avoid Shadowlands corruption. Iuchiban himself learned such techniques, as well as methods for summoning and controlling the undead. Bloodspeakers typically join a cult to learn these arts, but some learn them from corrupted spirits or by reading forbidden texts. Class Features As a Bloodspeaker, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per Bloodspeaker level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Bloodspeaker level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: Divination kit (see Adventures in Rokugan ) Saving Throws: Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Religion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted to you by your background: (a) resplendent regalia or (b) traveling clothes or (c) silk armor (a) dagger or (b) hatchet or (c) staff Divination kit Table 1-1: The Bloodspeaker Level Proficiency Bonus Features Words of Power Vitality Maximum 1st +2 Bloodspeaker's Cant, Malefic Words of Power, Vitality 2 3 2nd +2 Bloodspeaker Archetype, Interrogate Dead 2 4 3rd +2 Bloodspeaker Archetype Feature 2 4 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 3 5 5th +3 Whispers Turned to Weapons 3 5 6th +3 Bloodspeaker Archetype Feature 3 6 7th +3 Manifestation of Blood 4 6 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 7 9th +4 Blade of Blood 4 7 10th +4 Bloodbound Familiar 5 8 11th +4 Bloodspeaker Archetype Feature 5 8 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 5 9 13th +5 Bloodspeaker Archetype Feature 6 9 14th +5 Vile Curse 6 10 15th +5 Fiend’s Retreat 6 10 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 7 11 17th +6 Bloodspeaker Archetype Feature 7 11 18th +6 — 8 12 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 8 12 20th +6 Soul Transfer 8 13 Bloodspeaker’s Cant At 1st level, you learn means of communicating with the undead. Over the course of an hour, you can use a scrap of paper or other writing surface and a few drops of blood to create a glyph called the Bloodspeaker’s Sigil that allows the bearer to communicate with the fallen. While holding a Bloodspeaker’s Sigil, a creature can understand and be understood by undead and Lost creatures even if they do not speak the same language. Additionally, a Bloodspeaker’s Sigil grants the bearer advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks they make targeting undead. This benefit applies only if the undead creature is not under the control of anyone else, and only if it is not already hostile to the character. Malefic Words of Power As a student of forbidden occult arts, you have learned to speak malefic words of power, also known simply as malefic words, commanding malicious concepts into being to create abominations and devastate your foes. At 1st level, you know 2 malefic words from the list in Malefic Words of Power List. The number of malefic words you know increases at certain Bloodspeaker levels, as shown in the Malefic Words of Power column of Table 1–1: The Bloodspeaker. Save DC and Attack Modifier You use your Intelligence whenever a malefic word or other Bloodspeaker class feature refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Bloodspeaker malefic word or spell you cast and when making an attack roll using a malefic word or spell. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Vitality Many malefic words require you to expend a unique Bloodspeaker resource called vitality to use them. Starting at 1st level, you possess an amount of vitality determined by your Bloodspeaker level, as indicated in the Vitality Maximum column of Table 1–1: The Bloodspeaker. You recover all expended vitality when you finish a long rest. If a malefic word or another class feature requires you to expend vitality and you cannot expend the full cost, you are subjected to the effects listed under its Feedback section. Bloodspeaker Archetype When you reach 2nd level, you choose an archetype that lets you specialize further in your occult pursuits. Choose Summoner or Executioner, detailed at the end of this class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 3rd, 6th, 13th, and 17th level. Interrogate Dead At 2nd level, as an action, you can summon the soul of a humanoid corpse within 10 feet of you. The creature must have been alive within the last 24 hours and cannot be undead. The soul is imprisoned within its corpse; it can perceive its surroundings and speak (assuming the corpse still has a mouth) but cannot move in any other way. If you question the soul and it wants to resist answering you, it must make a successful Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to your spell save DC. If it fails, it must answer your question truthfully and has disadvantage on the next Charisma saving throw it makes to resist answering you. If it succeeds, the soul breaks free of your shackles and disappears. You can free the soul as an action, otherwise the soul is freed after 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Whispers Turned to Weapons At 5th level, when you use your action to cast a malefic word on a creature, you can make one melee weapon attack targeting that creature as a bonus action. Manifestation of Blood At 7th level, you have twisted your own vital essence, allowing you to unleash flurries of devastating blows in the blink of an eye. When you take the Attack action on your turn you may spend 1 vitality to make one additional attack. Blade of Blood At 9th level, as an action, you can spend 3 vitality to coat a melee weapon with cursed blood. A creature wielding this weapon gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus while attacking creatures that are bleeding or are affected by one of your baleful echoes. When you use this feature, any weapons previously enhanced by this feature lose their enhancement. Bloodbound Familiar At 10th level, you bind a malicious spirit to you by using vitality to sculpt a mortal form for it to inhabit. You can summon your bloodbound familiar by spending an action and 1 vitality. When summoned, the familiar appears within 5 feet of you, taking your choice of the form of a plague vermin, blood bat, or mutant leech. All three forms use the bloodbound familiar fare, with one of the three listed special rules depending on its form. On your turn, you may use a bonus action to have your bloodbound familiar move up to its speed and take one action. Your familiar is instantly destroyed if it is more than 60 feet away from you. If it is destroyed, you can resummon it after a short rest. Bloodbound Familiar (PB 2) Bloodbound Familiar (PB 3) Bloodbound Familiar (PB 4) Bloodbound Familiar (PB 5) Bloodbound Familiar (PB 6) Vile Curse At 14th level, your sorcery reverberates with an unholy force. Once per turn, after you resolve the effects of a baleful echo, you expend 1 vitality to resolve the effects of the baleful echo again against the same target. Fiend’s Retreat At 15th level, you know that death is just a few short breaths behind you at all times, and you have prepared sorcerous trickery to avoid its footfalls. When you would be hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to instantly swap positions with a creature you can perceive within 60 feet of you (you teleport to its position, and it simultaneously teleports to your position). The creature is hit by the attack, then gains the disoriented (it can’t make opportunity attacks) and marked for death (your next successful melee attack against it deals an additional 1d8 force damage) conditions for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Soul Transfer At 20th level, you may spend 8 hours performing a ritual to transfer your soul into the body of another living humanoid creature. Once the ritual begins, the target of this feature must remain within 30 feet of you for the duration of the ritual, or the ritual fails. Until the ritual is completed, you must remain in a state of intense concentration. If you take damage, cast any spells, or stop for any reason, you immediately take 20d6 psychic damage and the ritual fails. Completing the ritual forcibly expels the target’s soul, instantly killing them. Your soul then leaves its current body to permanently inhabit the body of the target. You retain all of your previous knowledge, skills, and abilities, but your age, Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability scores permanently change to those of the target. While you do not gain access to the target’s memories, this technique creates a perfect disguise that all but the most shrewd and suspicious investigators are unable to see past. Once you use this feature, whether it is successful or fails, you can’t use it again until at least 30 days have passed. Subclasses Summoner Executioner Words of Power and Malefic Words Malefic Words of Power are a major part of the secret knowledge that makes the Bloodspeakers the most feared practitioners of heretical sorcery. Like a True Name, each Word of Power calls to the essence of a thing. However, instead of drawing upon the power of a spiritual entity, each Word of Power manifests some abstract concept upon the world. Though Words of Power can be good or evil depending on their nature, the malefic words known to the Bloodspeakers all speak wickedness into being. Centuries ago, the first Bloodspeaker cults were taught these Words of Power by Iuchiban in exchange for their fealty, or as reward for horrific deeds carried out in his name. Today, most surviving Bloodspeaker cults possess only a few of these terrifying malefic words, and their schemes and machinations often center around seizing this ancient knowledge from rival sects. As such, an individual Bloodspeaker is unlikely to master all of the malefic words once known to Iuchiban, and any opposing Bloodspeaker might well possess strange, unexpected abilities that even a practitioner of these heretical arts is unprepared to overcome. Unlike invocations in Adventures in Rokugan , malefic words function as spells as described in the SRD. The Malefic Words of Power beginning on page 21 can be learned only by Bloodspeakers trained in the secret ways of Iuchiban, and they do not use spell slots. They can be cast at will, and their spell level is considered to be equal to the caster’s proficiency bonus for the purposes of effects that refer to spell level. Each malefic word has an effect that is resolved when it is cast, a baleful echo that continues to afflict some creature after it is cast so long as its vitality cost is paid, and a feedback result that the Bloodspeaker suffers if they fail to pay that vitality cost. For mechanical compatibility, malefic words have been assigned to schools of magic described within the SRD. However, these terms are not generally used by Bloodspeakers, who instead categorize these abilities by the historical lineage of the cults that preserved them across the centuries. Effects, Baleful Echoes, Upkeep, and Feedback Once spoken, a malefic word has an immediate effect upon its target unless they succeed on a saving throw, as detailed in the malefic word’s profile. Each profile also describes the malefic word’s baleful echo. A baleful echo afflicts its target with an ongoing consequence and exacts a vitality cost, called the upkeep, from the Bloodspeaker. The upkeep, which is specified in parentheses in the baleful echo’s description, must be paid at the start of each of the Bloodspeaker’s turns after they use the malefic word (or once every 10 minutes in narrative time). While a malefic word’s baleful echo is ongoing, the Bloodspeaker cannot use that malefic word again. The Bloodspeaker must continue expending this upkeep cost each turn until they silence the baleful echo or run out of vitality, triggering dangerous feedback that assails their own body (as listed in the malefic word’s Feedback entry). When a creature afflicted by a baleful echo is reduced to 0 hit points or dies, that baleful echo ends. A Bloodspeaker can use an action to silence baleful echoes initiated by their malefic words, ending a number of baleful echoes up to their proficiency bonus. Silencing a baleful echo removes its ongoing consequence from any afflicted creatures and stops its upkeep cost. It also does not trigger the malefic word’s feedback. A Bloodspeaker can silence any number of baleful echoes at the end of an encounter as a bonus action. If a Bloodspeaker hasn’t silenced the baleful echoes they have created and does not have enough vitality to expend the total upkeep cost, they must choose a number of echoes to end that will allow them to expend the upkeep cost for the remaining echoes. Since the Bloodspeaker is ending these echoes without using an action to silence them, the Bloodspeaker suffers the feedback results listed for each echo they are ending. Selection of Malefic Words The following are the selection of malefic words that a Bloodspeaker may select from as long as they meet the prerequisites. Confuse Debilitate Devour Dominion Dread Fester Forbiddance Hatred Mortality Scald Seethe Vengeance Multiclassing At the GM’s discretion, Bloodspeaker characters can use the multiclassing rules found in the SRD and Adventures in Rokugan . However, Bloodspeaker traditions are profane, and thus most spirits of the natural world or the Celestial Heavens do not deign to answer the invocations of Bloodspeakers. If a character has levels in the ritualist class and wishes to become a Bloodspeaker, it is recommended that they speak with their GM and remake their character as a Bloodspeaker of the same level with appropriate selections to reflect their history as a ritualist. While there is no mechanical reason a multiclass between these two classes could not work, and GMs may allow it at their discretion, it runs counter to the cosmology of Adventures in Rokugan . Characters of any other class may multiclass into the Bloodspeaker class provided they have access to the appropriate forbidden knowledge, which usually requires joining a Bloodspeaker cult (or seizing the information by raiding a cult’s library of profane texts). Additionally, the following information is important for multiclassing into the Bloodspeaker class. Multiclass Proficiencies Gained. When a character multiclasses into Bloodspeaker, they gain the following proficiencies: light armor, simple weapons, divination kit. Class Features. Some features of the Bloodspeaker class interact in specific ways with other class features, as described below. Manifestation of Blood and Extra Attack If a character uses the Manifestation of Blood feature and has the Extra Attack feature (such as from the bushi or duelist in Adventures in Rokugan ), the total number of attacks they can make as part of a single Attack action is equal to the higher number of attacks that would be granted to them by one of these features, not the combined value. In other words, if a character spends 1 vitality for 1 additional attack and has the Extra Attacks (2) feature, they can attack 2 times (1 + 1 base attack), not 4 times.",

When all else fails, you’ve always got a cutting observation or a really mean name in your back pocket, so they never get the last laugh. Prerequisites: None Hit Dice: 1d8 Hit Points: 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier Tools: One musical instrument of your choice Bonus Cantrips You learn the vicious mockery cantrip and one additional cantrip of your choice from the bard spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Taunt You can use your bonus action to mock a creature within 15 feet of you. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against a creature other than you before the end of its next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. I Meant to Do That When you roll a 10 or lower on the d20 roll for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.",

        "name": "Bushi",
        "description": "Many members of the samurai class of Rokugan are trained from birth in the arts of combat, tactics, and command. Commoners usually become bushi by circumstance, having been levied into service in wartime or trained by experience fighting marauders and wild creatures that threaten their home. A bushi might serve in a variety of roles over the course of their life: as a front-line combatant in the clan’s armies, a field commander, a guard captain at a castle or fortification, or an instructor to the next generation. Clan Traditions Each samurai clan of Rokugan has unique traditions for its bushi, passed down through the generations or developed to combat the unique challenges it faces. Crab Clan Traditions. Of the Great Clans of Rokugan, only the Crab Clan exists in a state of constant war, protecting the Emerald Empire against the ever-present threat of the otherworldly monsters that spill forth from the Shadowlands. As such, the Crab Clan teaches its disciples fortitude, courage, and practicality in equal measure. Horrors, demons, and the unliving are merciless foes, and bushi of the Crab Clan can’t afford to behave as though the fight against these creatures is going to be fair or chivalrous. Bushi trained in the Hida Defender tradition wear heavily plated armor and practice techniques for shattering iron hides with mighty hammer blows, while Hiruma Scouts are trained to observe and get out, only striking when the reward exceeds the risk. They are masters of survival and mobility, and use traps, ambushes, and poisons to even the odds against inhuman monstrosities. The Kaiu dōjō is not only a warrior college, but also the foremost engineering school in the Empire. Its engineers support the foot soldiers of the Crab by building bridges over inhospitable terrain, crafting armor strong enough to withstand even an oni’s blow, and designing and operating crossbows, ballistae, and other deadly war machines that let mere mortals triumph over massive foes. Even the Crab Clan’s secretive priests, the Kuni Purifiers, often train in warrior arts alongside their ritualist training, wielding blades alongside powerful invocations as they hunt down and scourge evil wherever it festers. The Crab Clan also uses peasant levies in battle far more regularly than other clans, and many villagers along the Kaiu Wall have been called to hold a spear in rank or aim a crossbow from atop the wall during times of crisis. Crane Clan Traditions. The Crane Clan’s diplomats generally prefer to avert war than fight it, but this does not mean its bushi are any less dedicated to mastery of battle than those of the other clans. The bushi from the Daidoji Iron Warrior dōjō form the core of their clan’s small standing army. They are highly trained heavy infantry who can hold the line and delay the advance of any foe. Many enemies have broken on the unwavering spears and iron discipline of the Daidoji Iron Warriors. When there are no wars for the Crane Clan to fight, many are assigned as protectors of Crane castles or as bodyguards to traveling Crane courtiers. Dragon Clan Traditions. The Dragon Clan almost never marches to war, and invasions of its lands have been even more infrequent across the centuries. Any protracted strike on the Dragon Clan’s mountainous domain has invariably stagnated into a brutal campaign of guerilla warfare, with its deadly Mirumoto-trained swordmasters harrying scouts or trapping their foes in narrow mountain passes to gain the edge against superior numbers. The Agasha family’s warrior-mystics are also deadly, as capable in hand-to-hand combat as they are at invoking the power of mountain spirits to collapse upon their foes. When acting outside of its own domain, the Dragon Clan’s bushi tend to be elite infantry who strike hard and fast to secure their objectives, withdrawing before the enemy responds in force. Lion Clan Traditions. The Lion Clan’s original mandate was in the creation of an empire, and it is still the primary protector of Rokugan against military threats foreign and internal to this day. The Akodo War College trains the finest strategic thinkers in the Emerald Empire, and members of other clans often study there. Its curriculum is focused on control: of one’s weapons, of the battlefield, over the flow of conflict, and ultimately, over oneself. Their goal is to achieve the pinnacle of the art of war: to minimize losses while achieving their objectives. On the other hand, the Matsu family trains the bushi who serve as the main strength of the Lion armies. The Matsu family dōjō teaches the primacy of offense and the necessity of seizing the initiative in all things. Phoenix Clan Traditions. The Isawa family’s authority is derived from spiritual knowledge rather than martial prowess, and their ritualists rarely take the battlefield. Therefore, in both wartime and peacetime, the Shiba family takes the lead on such matters. As Shiba swore to protect Isawa, so the Shiba Guardian School emphasizes the defense of and cooperation with the Isawa; its members complement and protect ritualists. The Shiba Guardians are broadly trained, often as much scholars and peacemakers as warriors. Scorpion Clan Traditions. The Scorpion Clan projects military power in traditional ways, and some among the Bayushi family are trained as commanders and warriors in addition to their education as courtiers and magistrates. Perhaps the finest bushi of the Scorpion Clan are the warrior monks of the Yogo Penitent sect, renowned for their use of the halberd and cold calm in battle. However, the Scorpion Clan’s most noteworthy military assets are its clandestine ones. Unicorn Clan Traditions. The core of the Unicorn military, the Shinjo Outrider tradition emphasizes speed and flexibility. All Shinjo Outriders learn the art of reconnaissance and how to get the most out of their horses. Their preferred weapon is the Shinjo horsebow, which they use with great accuracy even while riding at a gallop. In Unicorn battle plans, they are often the bait in a feigned retreat. The Moto tradition’s heavy cavalry serves as the hammer in these strategies, coupling speed with power to close the trap on enemy forces. To break the most difficult formations or hold the most desperate defenses, the Unicorn Clan deploys its most elite heavy cavalry, the Utaku Battle Maidens. The Utaku dōjō only accepts students who meet stringent standards of prowess and integrity, including taming a sacred Utaku steed. Field Training Many of the line troops in the Great Clans’ armies are commoners—levies from local communities, or volunteers seeking their chance at wealth or glory. Unlike the members of Rokugan’s formal warrior caste, the samurai, some of these characters might behave more like soldiers who serve vocationally. Nonetheless, the bushi class could be used to create a battle-weary campaigner who just wants to return to their home village, a fresh-faced youth who has not yet seen the harsh realities of warfare that await them, or a farmer whose skills have been developed protecting their village from wild animals and marauders. Bandits, town guards, criminal toughs, nameless wayfarers, champions from far-flung lands—any of these could also be represented by the bushi class. Quick Builds Generally, make either your Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, focusing secondarily on Constitution. If you intend to choose the Vanguard archetype, Charisma can also be helpful. Several iconic bushi of Rokugan can be found in the more detailed quick builds provided in the Backgrounds section, such as the Hida Defender, Daidoji Iron Warrior, and Moto Ranger.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d12 per bushi level Hit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per bushi level after the 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light and medium armor Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution, Wisdom Skills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion, and Stealth Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted to you by your background: (a) field gear and any one martial weapon or (b) animal-hide armor and any one martial weapon or (c) silk armor, a longbow, 20 willow-leaf arrows, 1 armor-piercing arrow, and 1 humming-bulb arrow. (a) any one simple melee weapon or (b) any one simple ranged weapon or (c) two daggers . Focus Points By understanding the rhythm of battle, you can find the exact right moment to begin pressing an attack, defend, or launch a finishing strike. This clarity in combat grants you access to the focus points that fuel your martial techniques. Your bushi level determines the maximum amount of focus points you can have, as shown in the Focus Maximum column of the Bushi table. Additionally: You start each encounter with 0 focus points. You gain 1 focus point at the end of each of your turns. When you unlock combat stances at 2nd level, you accrue additional focus points at the end of your turn based on your combat stance. At the end of an encounter, unspent focus points are lost. You can’t gain focus points while unconscious. Martial Techniques Martial techniques represent exceptional feats of martial prowess that you can perform in place of default combat actions, standard attacks, and reactions. At 1st level, you know the weave through the storm martial technique, detailed below. Weave Through The Storm At higher levels, you gain access to additional martial techniques chosen from the list. The number of martial techniques you know increases with your bushi level, as shown in the Martial Techniques column of the Bushi table. You can’t use the same martial technique more than once per turn. Each time you gain a bushi level, you can exchange up to 2 martial techniques you know for other options from the list. You cannot exchange specific martial techniques granted to you by your class or archetype features this way (such as weave through t he storm ). Combat Stance Starting at 2nd level, your combat experience has taught you several different stances you can adopt. Each stance has different strengths and gives you a specific bonus along with an additional way to gain focus points. You can have only one combat stance active at a time. When you roll initiative, you choose a stance to adopt, and you can switch between stances by spending your full movement or an action. Stances can only be used during combat encounters. Choose two stances you have mastered from the following list: Ember Stance You adopt a menacing stance that makes your foes think twice about approa ching you. Stance Effects: When a hostile creature that you can perceive ends its movement within 10 feet of you, you can spend your reaction to have it suffer the marked for death condition (your next successful melee attack against it deals an additional 1d8 force damage) for 1 minute. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 3 additional focus points if you reduced at least one hostile creature to 0 hit points since the end of your last turn. Mountain Stance You set your stance to protect against foes from multiple directions, using the fray of battle to guard the angles you must leave v ulnerable. Stance Effects: When there is at least one hostile creature within 5 feet of you, you benefit from half-cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws) against other hostile creatures’ attacks, invocations, spells, and other negative effects. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 1 additional focus point for each hostile creature within 5 feet of you. River Stance You keep mobile, swirling past your foes with a flowi ng stance. Stance Effects: Your movement speed is increased by +5 feet. Additionally, on your turn, you can spend a bonus action to perform a Dash, Disengage, Help, or Search action. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 1 additional focus point for each of the following actions that you performed: Dash, Disengage, Help, or Search. Willow Stance You maintain a loose stance that lets you throw sudden, unexpected strikes to catch your foes of f-balance. Stance Effects: During your turn, you can spend your bonus action to grapple or shove one creature within 5 feet of you. You can use Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of Strength (Athletics) for any contested checks you make as part of this action, Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 1 additional focus point for each contested check and each standard unarmed attack you made this turn. Sudden Clarity Starting at 2nd level, you can center yourself quickly on the battlefield, taking note of the opportunities and risks before you. At the start of your turn as a free action, you can use this feature to gain 1 focus point for each hostile creature you can perceive within 10 feet of you. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 9th level, when you use this feature, you also gain 3d6 temporary hit points. At 17th level, when you use this feature, you gain 3d12 temporary hit points instead of 3d6. Bushi Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that reflects your way of making war. Choose Samurai Armsmaster, Protector, or Vanguard, detailed at the end of this class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level, and increases to four at 20th level. Veteran’s Instincts Starting at 6th level, you become adept at steeling yourself against harm you have faced before. When you use your weave through the storm martial technique, you can use this feature to gain resistance to all damage types the attack deals for 1 minute. This is applied to that attack before the damage reduction of weave through the storm . Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. At 15th level, you can use this feature one additional time before finishing a short or long rest. Additional Combat Stance Starting at 10th level, you master one additional combat stance of your choice from the bushi list. Bushi Archetypes There are countless different ways of pursuing the bushi’s art, three of which are detailed here. The Protector archetype focuses on defense and survival, gaining access to heavy armor to assist in its goal. The Vanguard archetype is focused around flexible combat, picking the right tool for the job, and leading from the front as the tip of the spear. Samurai Armsmaster Protector Vanguard",

        "name": "Captain",
        "description": "A half-elf, adorned in the ribbons and medals of a high-ranking commander sits astride an armored warhorse. To her right, a powerfully built orcish man in more pedestrian attire sits atop his own horse, shouldering a hefty greataxe. They set down the road together, accompanied by blaring trumpets and banging drums, which announce their approach. Puffing on a pipe and eyeing the room, a halfling guildmaster in a fitted suit twirls a dagger between his fingers. A crowd of thieves, crooks, and bandits are arrayed before him, all studying blueprints laid out on a candlelit table. Tonight, their chapter of the Thieves’ Guild becomes rich, and their guildmaster goes down in history. Kobolds swarm left and right, scampering across piles of gold pieces, only to be met by the dwarf’s greataxe. Arrow after arrow, a human archer looses shots that merely plink off the enraged dragon’s crimson scales. A gnomish mage gathers crackling arcane might in his hands for a devastating magical blast. Across the chamber, amidst the chaos, a plan crystallizes in the adventuring company’s leader. She begins shouting orders, and the party sets into motion. Decisive leaders and brilliant strategists, captains inspire their allies to greatness. Invariably, they stand alongside their cohorts—their devoted lieutenants, whom they entrust with their lives. Captains out-strategize their enemies, ensuring that, while they rarely deal the killing blow, they’re always on the winning side. Fearless Leaders Many people aspire to command, but few inspire loyalty as a captain does. Captains rally allies to their side through confidence and determination, but gain long-term friends through wisdom and accountability. A good captain thinks a little bigger than their compatriots, planning one step further and fitting their allies like puzzle pieces to the challenges ahead. To their eyes, there are few defeats; only setbacks, diversions, and detours. Success is always on the path ahead. Moreover, captains lead by example. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder with knights, creep through the night alongside rogues, and study arcane texts with mages, even when they barely understand what they’re reading. Captains are at the front line with their allies, not barking orders from afar. Cohort and Commander A captain is only as good as their second in command, their cohort, who stands by them at every step and safeguards their plan’s success. Far more than a simple ally, a captain’s cohort is a confidant, an advisor, and a trusted friend. Cohorts see their captain as a wellspring of information, and will follow them to the ends of the earth. Creating a Captain The ideal captain—a consummate leader—can be realized in many different ways. Your captain could be a head of an adventuring company, an officer in an army, the president of a corporation, the chief of a tribe, the admiral of a fleet, or any other type of leader. The only commonalities amongst captains are their positions of authority and natural inclinations toward leadership. You should consider how your captain chooses to lead: not simply what banner they fly, but how they treat their followers and how they give orders. Do you rally others to your side with a magnetic personality or a stoic facade? How would you deal with a dilemma that offers only losing strategies? How do you treat your opponents once you’ve secured victory? You should also think of previous victories or defeats that have defined your captain in the past. Has your story been that of a meteoric rise or a disgraceful fall? What event first thrust you into leadership, and how did you first take to it? Which success or defeat led you to the life of an adventurer? Quick Build You can make a captain quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Next, select History and Persuasion as your skills, and take the Dueling Fighting Style. Lastly, choose a background reflecting your leadership experience.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per captain level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per captain level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution, Charisma Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Persuasion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor A dagger and (a) a warhammer, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts, (b) a shortbow and 20 arrows, or (c) 5 javelins An embroidered standard and (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack Born Leader By 1st level, your competence and commanding personality lend you a knack for leadership. Common folk defer to your authority and influence, especially in times of crisis. As a result, you have advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check you make to convince someone to let you take charge of a situation or to give someone orders in a dangerous situation. Additionally, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of your Intelligence, for any ability check you make related to planning, strategy, or tactics. You’re not a “hireling” if I don’t pay you! Fighting Style At 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Cohort Starting at 2nd level, you gain a loyal cohort who carries your banner and follows your lead. Initiating a Cohort Select a companion from the Cohort section; following an 8-hour initiation period, that creature becomes your cohort. You can have only one cohort at a time. If your cohort is ever slain, you can raise them from the dead by the usual methods, such as the raise dead spell, or you can spend 8 hours initiating a new cohort. If you do so, your previous cohort loses all abilities granted by this ability, even if it is later returned to life. Your cohort obeys your commands as best it can. Your cohort takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice), and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own. Cohort Features At 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels, your cohort gains new abilities based on its archetype. Hit Points For each captain level you gain after 2nd, your cohort gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly. Ability Scores Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your cohort’s abilities also improve. Your cohort can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise. When you improve a cohort’s ability scores, remember to also increase other relevant statistics, such as skill bonuses, bonuses to hit and damage, and spell save DCs. Proficiencies Your cohort gains proficiency in skills listed in its statistics. It also gains proficiency with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, or shields if its statistics contain weapons or armor from that category. Your cohort uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. Because cohort statistics already include a +2 proficiency bonus, you need only adjust the attack bonus, skill proficiencies, and saving throw proficiencies starting at 5th level. Alignment Your cohort’s alignment is within one step of your own, and has a personality trait and flaw determined by the GM. Its bond is always, “I will follow my commander into any fray, and I will gladly fight by their side until my death.” Banner Starting at 3rd level, you adopt a banner which you fly in combat, emblazon on your armor, and fix to your seal. You can select from the banners which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 13th, and 17th level. War Tactics Starting at 3rd level, you have a pool of battle dice that you can use to bolster your allies or perform special maneuvers in combat. You begin with 2 battle dice, which are d8s. You regain all expended battle dice when you finish a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative. Your battle die changes and more battle dice become available when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Dice column of the Captain table. Saving Throws If one of your maneuvers calls for a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Maneuvers You can spend battle dice to use the following maneuvers: Brace. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a battle die to bolster your allies. Each allied creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you adds the battle die to all saving throws it makes until the end of your next turn. Rally. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a battle die to choose one allied creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. That creature regains hit points equal to the number rolled + your Charisma modifier. You can’t use this ability to heal a creature that has 0 hit points. Staggering Strike. As a bonus action when you make a weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature, you can expend a battle die to attempt to daze the target. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Blitz Starting at 5th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can direct your cohort or a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you to fight alongside you. The chosen creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed or make a single weapon attack. Advanced Tactics At 9th level, your maneuvers improve in the following ways: Brace. Allies can also add the battle die to their ability checks until the start of your next turn. Rally. Whenever you spend a battle die to restore hit points to a creature, that creature also gains temporary hit points equal to your captain level. Staggering Strike. When you hit with a staggering strike, you add the battle die to the damage roll. Coordinated Strike By 11th level, you and your cohort fight as a perfect fighting unit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack, you can deal an extra 2d8 damage to the creature if your cohort has also hit that creature with an attack since the end of your last turn. Lead by Example Starting at 15th level, whenever you roll a 20 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you has advantage when it makes the same type of roll (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw) before the start of your next turn. Legendary Commander At 20th level, you have 3 legendary actions. At the end of another creature's turn, you can spend a legendary action to take an action of your choice, or allow a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can hear or see you to take an action of their choice. If a creature takes the Attack action as a legendary action, it can attack more than once if it has a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives it extra attacks. You regain all expended legendary actions when you finish a long rest. Banners Captains adopt emblems that denote their virtues, skills, and command styles, which they fly upon their banners to rally allies to their side. A symbolic statement, this heraldry speaks volumes about what a captain prizes in the world, be it knowledge, allies, or personal gain. Banners Name Description Dragon Banner Uses maneuvers to annihilate their foes on the battlefield Eagle Banner A bow master who uses precision shots to strike foes from high above Jolly Roger Banner A duelist and swashbuckler trained with a cutlass and the unfair tactics of brigands Lion Banner A knightly leader who challenges their foes to honorable combat Ram Banner Shoves their foes and knocks them prone to gain the upper hand in combat Raven Banner A stealthy master of guerilla warfare and covert tactics Turtle Banner Emphasizes defense above all else, using heavy armor and shield wall tactics",

You don’t have disadvantage on ranged spell attack rolls using this feature as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature. The effects of the spell are completely invisible, appearing as if you instead delivered a mighty blow with the weapon. Subtle Spell You can cast a spell without any somatic or verbal components.

        "description": "Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions. Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall. Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol⁠ as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions. Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest⁠, a cleric is imbued with divine magic⁠. Healers and Warriors Divine magic⁠, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling. Harnessing divine magic⁠ doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes. Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat⁠ training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side. Divine Agents Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and streng⁠th of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies. When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world. Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it. Creating a Cleric As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. Appendix B includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign. Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests⁠ of your faith regard you: as a champion⁠ or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special⁠ task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest? Quick Build You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.

See the general rules of spellcasting and the cleric spell list. Cant⁠rips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cant⁠rips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Can⁠trips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells⁠ The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells⁠ equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells⁠ requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting⁠ Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells⁠ comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting⁠ Focus You can use a holy symbol⁠ as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light⁠, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. Domain Spells⁠ Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. Channel Divinity: Turn Undead As an action, you present your holy sym⁠bol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Destroy Undead Starting at 5th level, when an undead⁠ fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. Destroy Undead Cleric Level⁠ Destroys Undead of CR... 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower Divine Intervention Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required. Divine Domains In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light⁠. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain. Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain⁠. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most. Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings⁠, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest . You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see \" Equipment \") as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. Divine Domain D p Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. Domain Spells Each domain has a list of spells -its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. Channel Divinity At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws . When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. Channel Divinity: Turn Undead D p As an action , you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead . Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw . If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage . A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions . For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Destroy Undead A Starting at 5th level, when an undead of CR 1/2 or lower fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed. Divine Intervention A Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action . Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest . At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required. Life Domain The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei). Table: Life Domain Spells Cleric Level Spells 1st Bless , Cure Wounds 3rd Lesser Restoration , Spiritual Weapon 5th Beacon of Hope , Revivify 7th Death Ward , Guardian of Faith 9th Mass Cure Wounds , Raise Dead Bonus Proficiency When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor . Disciple of Life Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. Channel Divinity: Preserve Life Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. As an action , you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct . Blessed Healer Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. Divine Strike At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack , you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. Supreme Healing Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.",

        "description": "A Miraculous Priest of Divine Power Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes. Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes. Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance , Sacred Flame , and Thaumaturgy are recommended. Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list . When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list , as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table . Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list . Bless , Cure Wounds , Guiding Bolt , and Shield of Faith are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table . Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric , your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells. Level 1: Divine Order You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor . Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list . In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks . The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). Level 2: Channel Divinity You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table. If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature. Divine Spark. As a Magic action , you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier . You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw . On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down). You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8). Turn Undead. As a Magic action , you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures . Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw . If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die. Level 3: Cleric Subclass You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain , Light Domain , Trickery Domain , and War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Sear Undead Whenever you use Turn Undead , you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect. Level 7: Blessed Strikes Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature). Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice). Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip . Level 10: Divine Intervention You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action , choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful. Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8. Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier . Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature , you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests . Cleric Spell List This section presents the Cleric spell list.

Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes. Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes. Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can. Becoming a Cleric … As a Level 1 Character Gain all the traits in the Core Cleric Traits table. Gain the Cleric’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Cleric Features table. As a Multiclass Character Gain the following traits from the Core Cleric Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance , Sacred Flame , and Thaumaturgy are recommended. Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list. When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table. Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless , Cure Wounds , Guiding Bolt , and Shield of Faith are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells. Level 1: Divine Order You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor. Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). Level 2: Channel Divinity You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table. If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature. Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down). You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8). Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die. Level 3: Cleric Subclass You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, and War Domain subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Sear Undead Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect. Level 7: Blessed Strikes Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature). Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice). Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip. Level 10: Divine Intervention You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest. Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful. Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8. Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests. Cleric Spell List This section presents the Cleric spell list.

        "description": "Unchained As a thief, killer, deceiver, trickster, and survivor, you navigate a perilous world where only stealth and cunning ensure survival. Branded an outcast, you dwell on life's fringes, traversing untrodden paths and backroads to diverse destinations and forces. Success isn't a guarantee on the longest trail. Offering one hand in friendship, the other conceals a blade, poised to strike. Your existence depends on a delicate dance of trust and betrayal in this dangerous realm. Haunted by past crimes, you constantly glance over your shoulder along the paths and roads you travel, aware that your history may catch up with you one day. You harbor undisclosed motives for your crimes, yet the world labels you a criminal, an escapee from due punishment, creating a stark contrast between your truth and public perception. d4 Crime 1 You murdered a man of the cloth. You have committed the ultimate blasphemy by killing a holy man. You cried vengeance, but to the community, you had committed the ultimate act of evil. 2 In a heated exchange, your dearest childhood friend met their demise at your hands. The truth behind the tragic incident is a burden you alone bear. 3 During a solemn winter night, your family was attacked and brutally murdered. You returned home and witnessed the gruesome crime scene. There was no clue of involvement by outside forces, and you are blamed for their demise. 4 You had to protect a caravan of traders and their families. They were ambushed and slaughtered; you failed to see the signs and clues and fled. You were captured soon after and convicted for neglect and cowardice.

        "name": "Courtier",
        "description": "The secrets, intrigues, and mysteries of Rokugan flow through its courtiers, who use their skill in rhetoric and keen insights to collect friends in high places and pursue clan and family agendas. Courtiers of the Great Clans act as rulers, advisors, artists, magistrates, bureaucrats, and scholars, and fulfill many crucial roles in the workings of these massive organizations. Commoners can be courtiers as well, and many village leaders, merchants, functionaries, and artists are just as skilled in the arts of persuasion as courtiers who are members of the samurai class. Clan Traditions Courtiers are vital to the functioning of the Great Clans of Rokugan, and each has its own traditions and protocols for diplomats, bureaucrats, and magistrates. Crab Clan Traditions. Detractors of the Crab Clan might say the Yasuki family is little more than a merchant house in samurai garb—the Yasuki would counter that members of their family are merchants, samurai, and much more. They are masters of the arts of commerce and the flow of commodities. The members trained in this tradition can acquire goods and services, even ones that a person may not yet know they need, in exchange for promises of assistance for their family and clan in the future. Some samurai see the Yasuki family’s focus on commerce as unseemly to the samurai class, but the Yasuki family teaches its students that the Crab Clan’s need for supplies in its unending war outweighs any petty concerns about etiquette that the pursuit of worldly good might raise. Crane Clan Traditions. No one plays the game of court better than the Crane Clan—after all, their predecessors wrote the rules. Diplomats trained in the Doji family tradition choreograph the courtly dance of favors exchanged, gifts given, and the right people invited to private gatherings. The Doji are always on the leading edge of fashion and culture, and Doji Diplomats need never use an unkind word: their silence speaks volumes, and a simple gesture says even more. Their networks of favors, gifts, and invitations allow them to weigh the ebb and flow of the social side of the Empire and adjust the scales to their benefit. Dragon Clan Traditions. The Dragon Clan is not known for its diplomatic presence in Rokugani courts, but it does have one very noteworthy school of courtiers. The Kitsuki family maintains a tradition of training investigators to master methods of observation, experimentation, logic, and reason to understand the truth and unveil mysteries. The Kitsuki Investigators gravitate toward legal work as magistrates and justiciars, in addition to serving as political representatives of the Dragon Clan. Lion Clan Traditions. In the end—after trials, sacrifices, and death—all that truly remains of a samurai is their story. The Ikoma Bard School trains its students as historians, bards, and tale-spinners, not just to preserve the stories of old, but to inspire the warriors of the Lion Clan to equal and exceed the achievements of their ancient ancestors. Ikoma Bards are no less warlike than the other scions of the Lion Clan. However, their most important duty lies in supporting each other. A member of the Lion Clan can fight against any odds with the confidence that no hero passes into history unsung. Phoenix Clan Traditions. The Asako family’s famous Loremasters study widely, and from that broad and firm base, they develop their specialties. It is rare for a Loremaster not to have at least passing knowledge of a subject, no matter how obscure. Acting as the courtiers of the Phoenix, the Asako Loremasters marshal arguments based on their expertise in the revered knowledge of the past. One should look for an Asako first in the library and then in court, usually deep in discussion. The Shiba family also teaches members of its Guardian School to defuse risky situations, helping prevent situations from reaching a point of violence. Scorpion Clan Traditions. Through the adept use of deception, exploitation, misdirection, and espionage, Bayushi-trained courtiers are the masters of using social skills to gather information about their rivals and allies alike. They are also trained in the subtle art of leveraging that information, keeping threats visible but veiled and blackmail deniable. In addition to its ritualist traditions, the Soshi family is also known for its Magistrate School, which instructs its students in interpretation and enforcement of the law. Unicorn Clan Traditions. The ever-friendly face of the Unicorn Clan is the Ide family. When the Unicorn Clan returned to Rokugan, it created a great deal of political and social turmoil, and it was emissaries and traders trained in the Ide family’s traditions that helped to build new bonds. While some of the other clans think of the Ide as soft, none can point to when they were able to take advantage of this perceived weakness. The Ide family teaches students to use their calm as a weapon, ignoring insults and politely welcoming compliments in equal measure. It also instructs them in knowledge of cultures both Rokugani and foreign, which allows its students to tailor their dealings with precision. Cities of Secrets and Stone Courtiers exist everywhere in Rokugan, but masters of rhetoric have truly flourished in cities. Merchant houses with wealth to rival the greatest of samurai families have arisen in some populous areas, as have powerful civilian organizations that provide key functions for these areas, such as firefighters. Additionally, crime syndicates have gained substantial influence in many cities—sometimes despite the efforts of the Great Clans, and other times with their direct, albeit clandestine, assistance. The politics of big cities can be as devious as any noble court, and the courtiers just as sharp and incisive. Quick Builds Generally, make Charisma your highest ability score. If you intend to select the Diplomat archetype, having a high Wisdom score is valuable, while Intelligence is a good choice for selecting the Investigator archetype. While these ability scores drive a large amount of your combat potential, Dexterity or Strength can also be helpful to make your attacks more effective.

Intrigue Dice With your insights, you can see into the hearts of others, and with your words, you can stir or provoke them to act. You start with two intrigue dice (d6s), which fuel your rhetorical flourishes (see below) and class features. When a rhetorical flourish calls for you to spend intrigue dice, you roll them and use the results of these dice as instructed. Additional Intrigue Dice Your maximum number of intrigue dice increases as described in the Intrigue Dice column of the Courtier table. Additionally, at 5th level, your intrigue dice become d8s. At 10th level, they become d10s. At 19th level, they become d12s. Intrigue Dice Recovery You regain half of your expended intrigue dice (rounding down) when you finish a short rest, or all of them after you finish a long rest. Additionally, you know how to capitalize on failed efforts, including your own. Whenever you spend one or more intrigue dice, recover one intrigue die for each result of 1 you rolled on those intrigue dice. Starting at 10th level, this triggers for each result of 1 or 2 on an intrigue die, and at 19th level, this feature triggers for each result of 1, 2, or 3 on an intrigue die. Rhetorical Flourishes You have access to one rhetorical flourish, which allows you to spend your intrigue dice to bolster the spirits of allies. It is a support flourish, which affects allies positively. Timely Advice (support, reaction). You speak words of warning to an ally at the precise moment they are needed, helping them evade harm. When a friendly creature is targeted by an attack or forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to spend and roll one or more intrigue dice, up to your proficiency bonus. The creature gains a bonus to its Armor Class for the attack or to its saving throw equal to the highest result among the intrigue dice. You and that creature must be able to perceive and understand each other for you to use this flourish (see Additional Rhetorical Flourishes ). Strategic Opening You are skilled at exposing and creating opportunities for your allies to exploit with your actions and your words alike. Once per round, when you attack or use a rhetorical flourish on a creature, you can expose one of its weaknesses. Until the start of your next turn, the next time a creature other than you hits the exposed target with an attack, it gains a bonus to its damage roll equal to your proficiency bonus or courtier level, whichever is lower. Starting at 13th level, when an attack that received this damage bonus reduces a creature you exposed to 0 hit points, you regain 1 of your spent intrigue dice. Additional Rhetorical Flourishes Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to more rhetorical flourishes, which allow you to spend your intrigue dice in new ways to sway, reinforce, or undermine characters around you. You learn two additional rhetorical flourishes from the following list. You learn one further flourish from this list at various higher levels (6th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 20th) as listed in the Rhetorical Flourishes Known column of the Courtier table. Your courtier archetype also grants you a specific flourish listed in its entry at 3rd level. In addition to support flourishes, there are two additional categories of rhetorical flourishes you can now choose: intuition flourishes and scheme flourishes. Intuition flourishes give new information called clues, which build up over time for powerful effects. Scheme flourishes affect enemies negatively. If a flourish requires you to choose a creature that can understand you, it must be able to derive meaning from your words or actions and must be able to perceive you. The GM is the final arbiter of whether a creature is a valid target for a given flourish. Each rhetorical flourish lists its category and action cost in parentheses after its name.

The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 9th, 14th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Reaction Starting at 6th level, have two reactions a round instead of one. You can only use one reaction per creature’s turn. At 15th level, this increases to three reactions per round instead of two. Rhetorical Mastery Starting at 11th level, you become extremely practiced in the classical strategies of rhetoric. Choose one of the following rhetorical styles: Astute: Once per round when you use a rhetorical flourish, you can treat the passive Perception score of a creature you target as reduced by your Wisdom modifier.

Courtier Archetypes Courtiers serve many different functions in the Emerald Empire. Some are Diplomats who focus on building bridges, maintaining alliances, and spinning courtly intrigues to the advantage of their family, clan, or organization. Others are Investigators by nature, asking incisive questions and hurling themselves into the complex vagaries of the world with curiosity and keen attention. Diplomat Investigator",

        "description": "A burly dwarf brings her hammer down on a glowing hunk of steel, launching a shower of sparks into the air. The room resonates with the sound of metal impacting metal, while the bright, hot piece of steel in her tongs begins to take shape. An elf threads a needle with an impossibly thin metallic wire, preparing to set the stitches into what looks to be leather armor, but made of dragon’s hide. Once satisfied with the measurements, he proceeds with a flurry of dexterous needlework. A gnome with an intricate set of goggles examines the stock for her latest work: a portable ballista. She examines the gearing and loading crank, ensures the tension on the bowstring, and scans the bolt rail for imperfections. She smiles, for she knows her work is without flaw. Craftsmen are virtuoso artisans and genius inventors. Not content merely creating masterwork pieces of weapons and armor, they invent and engineer ingenious devices and singularly deadly weapons. Master of Craft Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be sent to the kiln, tools must be forged. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force. Secret of Steel Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage their advanced knowledge of metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-produced items. Creating a Craftsman When you create your craftsman, the most important thing to consider is your crafting expertise. Though all craftsmen of adventuring stock can stitch leather armor, forge weapons, and tinker with magic items, only those who dedicate themselves to a single craft can attain legendary works. Each type of craftsman, from the practical to the wildly eccentric, have their place, but no craftsman can specialize in everything. Moreover, few craftsmen are self-taught. Most learn the finer points of their craft under the tutelage of a master artisan (whether or not their master was a craftsman, in the conventional sense). Did you study under a master, and if so, what drove you to apprentice underneath them? Lastly, consider how you view your work. Are you pragmatic, viewing your creations as tools to serve a purpose? Are you artistic, striving to craft pieces of unrivaled beauty and perfection? Or are you experimental, tinkering and building with wild abandon to break new ground and innovate on established norms? Quick Build You can make a craftsman quickly by following these suggestions. Make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Next, select Athletics and Investigation as your skills. Finally, choose a background befitting of your history of craftsmanship.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d10 per craftsman level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per craftsman level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: All armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: All artisan’s tools Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from: Arcana, Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Persuasion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: A set of craftman’s tools A shield and (a) chain mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) scale mail A dagger and (a) a warhammer or (b) any simple weapon (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) a shortbow and 20 arrows A dungeoneer’s pack Craftsman's Tools As a craftsman, you carry a set of craftsman’s tools, a combined toolkit that covers a broad range of applications. You can use a set of craftsman’s tools for any ability check you would make with any set of artisan’s tools. A set of craftsman’s tools costs 75 gp. Exotic Proficiencies Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with exotic weapons and exotic armor, which are unconventional, yet effective items with which no other class is proficient. If a feature or effect grants proficiency with a weapon or suit of armor, it doesn’t grant proficiency with exotic weapons or exotic armor, unless otherwise stated. Active Crafting Also at 1st level, you can craft one nonmagical item each day when you take a long rest, without losing the benefits of a long rest. You pay half the item’s gold piece cost in materials, up to 25 gp. If an item costs more than 25 gp in materials, you can finish the item by working on it for multiple days, spending 25 gp each day until the item is completed. As you gain levels in this class, your crafting speed increases, allowing you to spend more on materials for each day of crafting, as shown in the Active Crafting column of the Craftsman table. Items you craft using this feature are worth half their gold piece cost when sold. This means that you can sell an item to refund its cost in materials, but not to make a profit. Masterwork At 2nd level, you begin to learn the deeper intricacies of weapon and armor craftsmanship. Masterwork Equipment As a craftsman, you are capable of creating weapons and armor of the utmost quality; such creations are known as masterwork items. To create a masterwork version of an item, add 50 gp to the cost in materials you pay to craft the item. Masterwork weapons you create have a +1 bonus to attack rolls. A magic weapon that adds a bonus to your attack and damage rolls doesn’t add this bonus to attack rolls. Masterwork Properties Properties Craftsman Level Cost Apprentice 2nd - Journeyman 5th 100 gp Master 11th 250 gp Legendary 17th 400 gp Masterwork Properties Masterwork weapons and armor can be modified with masterwork properties, advanced modifications that transform them into truly unique weapons and armor. Masterwork properties are separated into 4 levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Master, and Legendary. You can apply any number of Apprentice properties to a masterwork weapon, or up to three Apprentice properties to a masterwork suit of armor. Additionally, you can apply one Journeyman, one Master, and one Legendary property to each masterwork item. If you add a Master or Legendary property to an item, only you can use it. Modifying Equipment Using the Active Crafting feature, you can modify a weapon or suit of armor when you take a long rest. This allows you to do the following: Improving Equipment. You can make any nonmagical weapon or suit of armor masterwork for a cost of 50 gp in materials. Adding Masterwork Properties. Adding masterwork properties of Journeyman level or higher requires a cost in gold pieces and also requires you to be of a high enough level in this class, as shown in the Masterwork Properties table. When you learn a new level of masterwork properties, you can apply a property from that level to a masterwork item at no cost. Check the Weapons Exceptions sidebar later in this chapter before adding masterwork properties to a weapon. Whenever you modify the properties of a masterwork weapon, you can change its damage type to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, if its damage was already one of these types. Removing Properties. You can remove any properties of a masterwork item, including those a weapon had when you first created it. You can’t remove a property from an item that is a prerequisite for another of the item’s properties. If you replace a property of Journeyman level or higher with a property of the same level over the same long rest, you can do so without an additional cost in materials. Crafting Ability Intelligence is the primary ability you use when crafting items. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for items that you craft. Masterwork save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Tool Belt By 2nd level, you always have the right tool at hand. You can use your action to retrieve a piece of nonmagical gear from your belt, pack, cart, or wherever you keep your tools, even if you didn’t have it in your inventory before. The item’s gold piece cost can be up to 50 gp. You can’t use this feature to produce a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or potion. An item retrieved in this way becomes lost in your inventory and vanishes when you finish a long rest. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Artisans’ Guild At 3rd level, you join an Artisans’ Guild. Select one of the Guilds from those listed below; you gain the 3rd level feature of that guild. You gain an additional Guild feature at 7th, 10th, 14th and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Folded Steel At 6th level, you discover or create new processes for making your masterwork gear even stronger than before. Masterwork weapons crafted or modified by you count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Downtime Crafting Any character can craft nonmagical items in their downtime; the craftsman is simply better at it. To craft an item, a character requires three things: Materials. In most cases, the raw materials for an item can be obtained for half the item’s gold piece cost. This cost can fluctuate depending on the character’s current circumstances, contacts, or access to materials. Tools. You must have a set of appropriate artisan’s tools and proficiency with them to craft an item. Occasionally, an item might call for an entire workshop or other special tools. Time. The time required to craft an item is measured against its cost in materials. A character makes progress toward crafting an item equal to 5 gp for each day of downtime, completing their work when this amount exceeds the item’s cost in materials. As a craftsman, you work faster than a normal character, and make progress equal to 10 gp progress each day. You can sell any item you craft during your downtime for its total gold piece cost. As such, if you run a shop or craft items during your downtime purely to make profit, you can make 5 gp per day, assuming you sell all of your items. Eye for Quality Starting at 9th level, you can cast the identify spell at will, without using a spell slot or spell components. Additionally, when you cast the spell, you also appraise the target item, learning its market value in gold pieces. Flawless Construction Beginning at 13th level, masterwork items you create don’t rust, pit, fray at the edges, or otherwise show signs of aging. Additionally, they have resistance to all damage. Items you create can only be destroyed by effects that can destroy magic items. Uncanny Tool Belt By 15th level, you have a knack for finding the most useful things buried away in your cart. You can produce a single common or uncommon magic item from your tool belt. The item becomes lost in your inventory and vanishes when you finish a long rest. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Magnum Opus At 20th level, you complete an object of unparalleled majesty. You work feverishly for a period of 30 days to create a single magic item of very rare or legendary rarity. This item is tied to your very soul: regardless of type, you are always considered attuned to it, and no other creature can attune to it while you are alive. This item doesn’t count against your maximum number of attuned items, and you ignore all attunement requirements for the item. As long as you are on the same plane of existence as your item, you can use a bonus action to call it to your hand or onto your body (as appropriate). You can only craft a Magnum Opus once. Artisans’ Guilds All master craftsmen learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under the tutelage of another master artisan. However, as they hone their skills, they invariably find themselves drawn to gatherings of other like-minded craftsmen. These groups, formalized as Guilds, provide a means for craftsmen to compare notes and schematics, acquire resources, and provide a means for craftsmen to ply their trade. Artisan's Guild Name Description Arcane Maesters' Guild Magical craftsmen that forge mundane steel into magic items Armigers' Guild Armorsmiths of great renown that wear reinforced steel Bladeworkers' Guild Weaponsmiths who build innovative implements of war and train in their use Calibarons' Guild Gunsmiths who develop advanced firearms and attachments Forgeknights' Guild Wields a portable forge to heat their weapons and armor to explosive limits Mechanauts' Guild Pilots a modified apparatus of the crab, a walking construct of fearsome power Thunderlords' Guild An electric innovator that uses lightning-charged equipment Trappers' Guild A mechanical tinkerer that deploys lethal booby traps during combat Masterwork Properties Masterwork properties can be applied to any masterwork weapon or suit of armor, provided you can spare the time and gold cost required to apply it. Each property entry details the property’s level and the type of equipment it can be applied to. Unless otherwise noted, a piece of gear can’t have the same property more than once; for example, you can’t apply the Heavy property to a greatsword, or the Martial property to a longbow. Damage Steps If a masterwork property increases or decreases a weapon’s damage, it is moved up or down one step on the following scale, down to a minimum of 1d4: 1d4 → 1d6 → 1d8 → 1d10 → 1d12 or 2d6 Further increases add a +1 bonus to the weapon’s damage roll. If the weapon being modified has 2 damage dice (such as a greatsword or a firearm), the scale is instead: 2d4 → 2d4 + 1 → 2d6 → 2d6 + 1 → 2d8 → 2d8 + 1 → 2d10 → 2d10 + 1 → 2d12 Weapon Properties The following masterwork weapon properties are organized by crafting level. If a masterwork property adds a weapon property that is new to this class, it includes that property in its description. Generally, Apprentice properties can be used to fashion nearly any type of simple, martial, or exotic weapon, though some weapons might require one Journeyman property as well. Master and Legendary properties, by contrast, are used almost exclusively by master craftsmen on their personal equipment. Masterwork properties applied to ranged weapons apply their effects to their ammunition, if applicable. Apprentice Weapon Properties Aerodynamic Automatic Balanced Concealable Elegant Exotic - Weapon Extended Magazine Finesse Firearm Fist Foregrip Heavy Light Loading Martial Parrying Reach Reload Returning Scatter Sighted Superheavy Switch Thrown Trip Two-Handed Versatile Variant Damage Dice With the GM’s permission, you can exchange your exotic weapon’s damage dice for an equivalent variant. Sets of dice are equivalent when the sum of the largest numbers of each set of dice are equal. For example, you can replace a weapon that deals 1d8 with 2d4 or a weapon that deals 2d12 with 4d6 or 3d8. Changing Weapon Ranges A ranged weapon’s long range is either three times its normal range or four times its normal range, depending on the type of projectile it fires. When a masterwork property changes a weapon’s normal range, change the long range by three or four times the amount, as appropriate to the weapon. You can’t apply a weapon property if it would reduce a ranged weapon’s normal range to 0 feet, and you can’t remove the Ammunition or Thrown properties from a ranged weapon. Blaster In high-tech settings, such as the Dark Matter campaign setting, many weapons release blasts of energy instead of conventional projectiles. The Blaster property replaces the Firearm property in such settings. All rules that apply to firearms apply to blasters as well. For the purpose of applying masterwork properties, blasters count as ranged weapons with the Ammunition and Reload properties. You can also apply the Overheat and Variable properties listed below to blasters. Blaster Variable Overheat Journeyman Weapon Properties You can apply only one Journeyman property to a weapon at a time. You can’t apply a Journeyman property to a weapon that already has one. Counterweighted Double Explosive Heat Magical - Journeyman Massive Mounted Precision Rocket Sniper Tension Twinshot Weapon Exceptions Some weapons, in the name of verisimilitude, have unusual balancing that makes them slightly stronger or weaker compared to weapons a craftsman might usually craft. If you modify one of these weapons as a craftsman, first remove any of the weapon’s Special properties, then check following rules: Assault Rifle. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d6 + 1 and decrease its reload to 10. Bayonet, Whip. Increase the weapon’s damage to 1d6. Blowgun, Bolas, Bomb, Net. This weapon can’t be modified by masterwork properties. Boomerang, Doomerang, Throwing Dagger. Add the Aerodynamic masterwork property. Catchpole, Trident. Increase the weapon’s damage to 1d8. Gatling Gun. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d8 + 1, and decrease its reload to 10. Handaxe. Decrease the weapon’s damage to 1d4. Handgun, Revolver. Decrease the weapon’s range to 50/200 ft. Hunting Rifle. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d6 + 1. Javelin. Decrease the weapon’s range to 20/60 ft. Lance. Add the Two-Handed property and decrease the weapon’s damage to 1d8. Light Cannon. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d12 + 1. Longbow. Decrease the weapon’s range to 100/400 ft. Magnum, Explosive Magnum. Add the Two-Handed property and increase the weapon’s range to 100/400 ft. Musket, Volley Gun. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d8 + 1. Parlor Gun. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d4 + 1. Rocket Launcher. Increase the weapon’s damage to 2d12 + 1 and add the Mounted property. Master Weapon Properties You can apply only one Master property to a weapon at a time. Adamantine - Weapon Blessed Earthshatter Elemental Keen Magical - Master Mithral Serrated Slaying Vampiric Venom Modified Weapons Once you modify a weapon’s properties, it may no longer resemble its original function or profile. The GM decides if a modified weapon still counts as its base form for characters that have proficiency with it and for features which refer to a specific type of weapon (as opposed to a category of weapons, such as simple or martial weapons). Legendary Weapon Properties You can apply only one Legendary property to a weapon at a time. Crushing Deadly Magical - Legendary Penetrating Seeking Threatening Vorpal Whirlwind Armor Properties The following armor properties are organized by crafting level. Generally, exotic armor is made using the Exotic property, while the other Apprentice properties are used to tailor a suit of armor to a craftsman’s personal tastes. Higher-level properties, by contrast, drastically alter suits of armor to which they are applied. Apprentice Armor Properties You can apply a maximum of three Apprentice properties to a suit of armor. Cleated Climbing Comfortable Environmental Exotic - Armor Integrated Quick-Change Retractable Scaled Spiked Journeyman Properties You can apply only one Journeyman property to a suit of armor at a time. Adamantine - Armor Arcane Arrow-Catching Diving Juggernaut Maneuvering Mithral Resistance Master Armor Properties You can apply only one Master property to a suit of armor at a time. Animated Cloaking Clockwork Glamoured Trollskin Winged Legendary Armor Properties You can apply only one Legendary property to a suit of armor at a time.

        "name": "Cybermancer",
        "description": "Peering beneath the surface, his surroundings burst into a vibrant collection of data streams and commands. He brushes his fingers along the surface of a command board that only he can see. His implant runs white-hot, coursing with stings of commands granting him control of the energies that shape the universe. Cybermancers are espers who can view the world as if it were a complex, digital design. Through this unique perspective, they can decipher and manipulate energy at a molecular level, almost as if recoding a machine. Such abilities often awaken through their own exposure to the advanced technologies that preside over day to day life. Over the years, many of them have earned the nickname “world-hacker.” Interlaced Reality Cybermancers have two different perspectives. One is the world as viewed by the mundane eye. The other is that of a weave of data streams and codes, superimposed on top of the mundane view. Much like the augmented reality experienced by SIM users, cybermancers refer to this as their Interlaced Reality— an advanced user mode that enables them to “hack the world” and manipulate its energies. Though the cybermancer’s control over the physical world and the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix (SIM) are completely separate, the concepts are very much the same. This is why many cybermancers often come from those skilled in either computers or other technical sciences. Program Personified In the SIM, users are represented by a digital avatar often known as a persona. Cybermancers likewise possess a persona that manifests itself whenever they channel their powers through their sorium device, usually an implant that interfaces directly with the brain. While a cybermancer’s persona can be of any chosen design, it is common for it to be a combination of their own personality and the path they’ve chosen to follow as an esper. Some cybermancers believe their persona may have actually chosen them instead of the other way around. Creating a Cybermancer While creating your cybermancer, take a look at your character’s personality and life experiences. Do they have a love for technology or have a natural aptitude for it? Perhaps they have a career as a technician or scientist. Perhaps they were instead exposed to it since birth. Or maybe they discovered a secret language deep in the ruins of the older races that somehow resonated with them? You may then wish to decide how you’ve adjusted to these awakened abilities and what impact they may have had on your life since then. Ability Scores Intelligence should be your primary ability score followed by Constitution. Strength or Dexterity could be useful for weapon use.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per cybermancer level Hit Points at 1st Level : 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cybermancer level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: Choose one from Digital Technician’s tools and Hacker’s kit Saving Throws: Charisma, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Astrophysics, Computers, Insight, Investigation, Lore, Persuasion, and Xenobiology Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a light pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition or (b) any simple weapon (a) two combat knives or (a) any simple weapon (a) a technician’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack Armor jacket, a SIM Unit and a Portable shield device (PSD) Persona Form At 1st level, you have a persona that represents your inner identity. It’s appearance is often similar or identical to your persona in the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix (see Chapter 12 for more information on the SIM). Your project this persona through your sorium implant, translating your interlaced reality into effects in the physical world. You can choose whether or not your persona is visible to others whenever you use your class features and powers. Your choice of a persona form grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Code Channeling Your ability to weave codes into potential physical energy grants you access to a particular set of talents. See chapter 10 for general rules on esper powers and chapter 11 for the cybermancer powers list. Prime Talents You know two talents of your choice from the cybermancer talents list. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Prime Talents column of the Cybermancer table. Talent Slots A cybermancer’s persona uses a certain amount of memory to interface with the environment and create slots used to output esper powers. The Cybermancer table shows how many slots you have. The table also shows the rank of those slots; all of your talent slots are the same rank. To use a talent of rank 1 or higher, you must expend a talent slot. You regain all expended talent slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two rank 3 talent slots. To use the rank 1 talent avatar’s armor , you must spend one of those slots, and you activate it as a rank 3 talent. Talents Known of Rank 1 and Higher You know two rank 1 talents of your choice from the cybermancer powers list. The Talents Known column of the Cybermancer table shows when you learn more talents of your choice of rank 1 or higher. A talent you choose must be no higher than what’s shown in the Slot Rank column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new cybermancer talent, which can be from any rank between 1 and 3. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose from one of the cybermancer talents you know and replace it with another talent from the cybermancer powers list, which must also be of a rank for which you have talent slots. Channeling Ability Intelligence is your channeling ability for your esper powers, so you use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your channeling ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an adept power you use and when making an attack roll with one. Channeling save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Channeling attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Complex Patterns Your unique skills allow you to compile energy patterns that imbue you with a particular esper ability or effect. At 2nd level, you gain two complex patterns of your choice. Your pattern options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain cybermancer levels, you gain additional patterns of your choice as shown in the Complex Patterns column of the Cybermancer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the patterns you know and replace it with another pattern that you could learn at that level. Advanced Interface At 3rd level, your persona gains a specialty interface, granting you one of the following features of your choice. Extended Interface You learn the bonded companion power and can activate it as a conventional talent. The talent doesn’t count against your number of talents known. When you activate the talent, you can choose one of the normal forms for your ally or one of the following special forms: bit drone, power sprite, or spyder. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your ally to make one attack of its own with its reaction. Combat Interface You can use your action to create a weapon bond, which appears as a melee weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as forge enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to mundane attacks and damage. Your weapon bond disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can adapt one forge enhanced weapon to be your weapon bond by performing a special technique while you hold the weapon. You perform this technique over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your weapon bond thereafter. You can’t affect a cypheos or core-bonded weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your weapon bond if you die, if you perform the 1-hour technique on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour technique to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Memory Interface You forge a small piece of sorium into a flat object shaped like a datacard. It is specifically attuned to your implant. When you gain this feature, choose three prime talents from any class’s powers list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the card is on your person, you can use those talents at will. They don’t count against your number of prime talents known. If they don’t appear on the cybermancer powers list, they are nonetheless cybermancer talents for you. If you lose your datacard, you can craft a new one during a 1-hour process. This process can be performed during a short or long rest, and it nullifies the previous card. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Esper Mastery At 11th level, your mastery of the code grants you the ability to channel advanced esper talents. Choose a rank 6 talent from the cybermancer powers list. You can activate this power once without expending a talent slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more cybermancer talents of your choice that you can use in this way: One rank 7 at 13th level, one rank 8 at 15th level and one rank 9 at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Esper Mastery when you finish a long rest. Master Cipher At 20th level, your persona can tap into the energies around you to regain expended talent slots. You can spend 1 minute focusing to regain all your expended talent slots from your Code Channeling feature. Once you regain talent slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. Cybermancy and Esper Powers Though cybermancers gain their abilities through their understanding of the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix (SIM), their skills in the SIM and their powers in the physical world have no relation to each other. The “code” they see is of their own design and does not translate to any known computer or programming language. The cybermancer’s understanding of “hacking” the world is merely how they see and control the energies around them, much like how a melder uses their bodies as energy conduits, while an adept uses the psychic links between themselves and others around them. Likewise, a cybermancer’s persona is a manifestation of their powers as an esper, having no direct relation to their persona in the SIM. See Chapter 12 for more information about the SIM. Persona Forms Every persona has a specific pattern and primary structure that make up its form. The persona a cybermancer chooses is representative of the powers and complex patterns they can access as an esper, as well as the method in which they are utilized. Some cybermancers may choose a humanoid persona that defines what they feel is their true personality. Some might choose a beast or figure of legend, while others lean toward something less common such as a weapon or a burst of elemental energy. Cybermancers who communicate regularly in the SIM can often identify each other by their personas in the physical realm. Breaker Controller Ghost Complex Patterns If a complex pattern has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the pattern at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. Adversary Impaired You can activate impedance once using a cybermancer talent slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Spelcasting Ability Your spellcasting ability as a Delver of the Abyss is Charisma, reflecting your connection with the plane of darkness and summoning creatures from other planes. Whenever a spell mentions your spellcasting ability, rely on your Charisma. Furthermore, when determining the saving throw DC for your Delver of the Abyss spells or making an attack roll with them, apply your Charisma modifier. Here's how to calculate these values: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Level 1 Portal Conjurer: As a bonus action, you can conjure twin portals that allow you to move between them by briefly traversing the Plane of Shadows. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one within 5 ft. of you and the other up to 60 ft. from you; you create two swirling circles of dark energy in these spots. In the turn you use this feature, you can’t cast spells, except for Cantrips with casting time of 1 Action. When you touch one of these portals (as your free object interaction on your turn) you can teleport to any empty space within 5 ft. of the other one. Unless otherwise specified, other creatures are unaffected and unimpeded by the portals. The distance at which you can place the second portal increases to 90 feet at 6th level, 120 feet at 10th level, and 180 feet at 14th level. When you cast a Conjuration spell with a range of “Self (distance)”, you can have it originate from one of your portals instead of you; or calculate the range from one of your portals instead of from you. You can only do so if you are within 5 ft of one of your portals when you cast the spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Dark Matter: As a bonus action you can spend your life force to harm or assist. If you target an enemy, make a melee spell attack against an enemy within 5 ft. of you. On a hit, spend one Hit Dice; the enemy suffers cold damage equal to the roll plus your Charisma modifier. You gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage of the attack. If you touch a willing creature, spend one Hit Dice. You regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier; the creature regains hit points equal to the value of the roll plus your Charisma modifier. Horns: Protruding from your forehead, they serve as a testament to your link with the planes of darkness. They are a diabolical sight to behold. You gain advantage on Intimidation Checks. Level 2 Scent of Evil: As an action, you can detect the presence of infernal creatures within 60 ft. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any fiend, even if it is behind total cover, but the effect is blocked by three feet of stone or one foot of metal. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Explorer: You have experience traveling at night and through underground tunnels, dungeons, and caves. In these circumstances, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks. Level 3 Embrace the Void: when you are about to damage an enemy with a spell or feature, you can choose to open yourself up to the Plane of Darkness. You and the enemy take additional cold damage equal to your Charisma modifier. If you damage multiple enemies with the same spell or feature, you can choose which ones are affected by this feature; in that case, add together the instances of cold damage you are about to take before applying resistances or other effects. Life Infusion: Whenever you damage a creature, you bind their essence to you. If a creature you have damaged in the previous 10 minutes dies, you regain a Hit Dice; alternatively, you can choose to regain hit points equal to your Delver of the Abyss level + your Charisma modifier. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Level 4 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see PHB Chapter 6 for a list of feats). Level 5 Arcane Infusion: when you use your Life Infusion feature, you can choose instead to recover a spent Spell Slot. Every day, you can recover spell slots that have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Delver of the Abyss level (rounded up). Bountiful Portals: you can use your Portal Conjurer feature again after you finish a short or long rest. Level 6 Demon Trap: As an Action, you can cast a powerful bolt of magic against a fiend within 60 ft of you. They must succeed on a WIS SAVE or become trapped in a magical café for 1d4 rounds. While they are trapped, they are incapacitated and their speed becomes 0. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Ether Visage: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened by celestials, fiends and undead. Level 7 Unstable Portals: As an action, you can disperse the arcane energies within your portals with explosive effects. Choose one or both of your portals; every creature within 5 ft. of one or more of them must succeed on a DEX SAVE or take 6d6 force damage (or half as much on a successful save). All your portals disappear afterwards. Delving Deep: You can prepare an additional Delver of the Abyss Spell. This spell can be of any level you have access to. Level 8 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see PHB Chapter 6 for a list of feats). Level 9 Additional Portal: When you use your Portal Conjurer feature, you can create three portals instead of two. The third portal has the same distance limitation as the second one. Dark Domain: You gain resistance to cold and necrotic damage. Level 10 Darker Matter: When you successfully hit a creature with any spell attack, you can use your Dark Matter feature without a need to make another attack roll. Enjoy the Silence: When your hit points are about to be reduced to 0 from damage caused by your Embrace the Void feature, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Delving Deeper: You can prepare an additional Delver of the Abyss Spell. This spell can be of any level you have access to. Level 11 Our Kind: As a bonus action, you can camouflage yourself as a fiendish creature. Until the start of your next turn, no fiend can target you with attacks, spells or effects that target only you. During this time, allies can’t target you with beneficial spells or effects that target only you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Shimmering Infusion: when you use your Life Infusion feature, you can choose instead to gain temporary hit points equal to your Delver of the Abyss level + your Charisma modifier. Level 12 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see PHB Chapter 6 for a list of feats). Level 13 Delving Deeper: You can prepare an additional Delver of the Abyss Spell. This spell can be of any level you have access to. Level 14 Terror Aura: As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose to suffer cold damage equal to one of your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier. If you do so, until the start of your next turn you gain the benefit of half cover against any attack, spell or effect targeting you. Level 15 Eyes of the Abyss: As a Bonus Action, you can ignite your eyes with a magical glare towards an enemy within 30 ft of you. They must succeed on a WIS SAVE or become Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. While frightened by this feature, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. Fiends that are immune to the frightened condition can not benefit from their immunity against this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Level 16 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see PHB Chapter 6 for a list of feats). Level 17 Astral Enchantment: You gain advantage on saves against spells. You also gain advantage on saves against the effects and abilities of Fiends. Delving Deeper: You can prepare an additional Delver of the Abyss Spell. This spell can be of any level you have access to. Level 18 Portal Absorb: When you create a portal within 5ft of an enemy, they must succeed on a CON SAVE or be consumed by the Portal and taken to the Plane of Darkness. Only works on creatures with a CR rating of 8 or below. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Level 19 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see PHB Chapter 6 for a list of feats). Level 20 Mirrrors of the Past. You transform into ethereal matter forged from the Plane of Darkness. You gain the following abilities: Innocuous: You gain immunity to necrotic damage and resistance to all other damage types. Voice of Darkness: Once per long rest, you can unleash a scream that can only be heard by the creatures you choose within a 90-foot radius. Each creature that can hear the scream must make a CON SAVE or take half their maximum hit points in necrotic damage (or a quarter on a successful save). Portal Mirror: Allies within 30 ft. of you can travel through your portals by touching them the same way you do.

Many flee in terror, but a few fall to their hands and knees, pledging themselves to their new draconic masters. Such dragon acolytes learn to emulate the great beasts, and eventually to capture a semblance of draconic that might. Prerequisites: Allied with a dragon or an aspect of the dragon god Hit Dice: 1d10 Hit Points: 1d10 (6) + your Constitution modifier Draconic Alliance Dragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold Draconic Alliance When you gain this level, you become allied with an ancient wyrm or an aspect of the dragon god, who grants you a fraction of their power. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon, as shown on the Draconic Alliance table. Breath Weapon When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). A creature takes 2d8 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Alliance on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (3d8), 11th level (4d8), and 17th level (5d8). Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until it recharges. Roll a d6 at the start of each of your turns; the ability recharges when you roll a 6. Claws and Bite You can manifest claws and teeth of crackling draconic magic, which are natural weapons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. On a hit with them, you deal 1d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Alliance. You can choose to deal slashing damage with the claws or piercing damage with your bite. If you already have natural weapons, you can choose to deal the type associated with your Draconic Alliance instead of its normal damage type.",

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list . You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest . You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see \"Equipment\") as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest . Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. Table: Beast Shapes Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 — Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment , personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions , you can't use them. When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious . You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning , that you've already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision , unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land . Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Circle of the Land The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic . The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. Natural Recovery Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. Circle Spells Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land— arctic , coast , desert , forest , grassland , mountain , or swamp —and consult the associated list of spells. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. Nature’s Ward When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease . Nature’s Sanctuary When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe . Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs , as well as shields . Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins . Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in Pantheons include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.",

        "description": "Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest. Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities. Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf char⁠ges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life. Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomita⁠ble will. Power of Nature Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines. Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form. Preserve the Balance⁠ For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers. Creating a Druid When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny. Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose. Quick Build You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message⁠. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Spellcasting Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See the general rules of spellcasting and the druid spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. Preparing and Casting Spells⁠ The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells⁠ equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells⁠ requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting⁠ Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. Sacred Plants and Wood A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants⁠ as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with stre⁠ngth. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants⁠ to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants⁠. Wild Shape Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed. Beast Shapes Level⁠ Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 — Giant eagle You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics⁠ of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them. When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious. You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning , that you’ve already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special⁠ senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment⁠ functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment⁠ doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment⁠ that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment⁠ that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Druid Circle At 2nd level, you choose to identify⁠ with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Timeless Body Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Beast Spells⁠ Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components. Archdruid At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape. Druids and the Gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa. In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration. The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command⁠ these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic⁠ is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations. Druid Circles Though their organization is invi⁠sible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other. At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.

Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction. Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles. Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

See \" Spells \" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list . Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended. Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list . When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list , as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table . Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list . Animal Friendship , Cure Wounds , Faerie Fire , and Thunderwave are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table . Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid , your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells . Level 1: Druidic You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids . While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared. You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Level 1: Primal Order You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks . The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor . Level 2: Wild Shape The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action , you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action . Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table . Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see \" Creature Stat Blocks \" for stat block options). The Rat , Riding Horse , Spider , and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form. When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed . When choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so. Beast Shapes Druid Level Known Forms Max CR Fly Speed 2 4 1/4 No 4 6 1/2 No 8 8 1 Yes Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply: Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level. Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points ; Hit Point Dice ; Intelligence , Wisdom , and Charisma scores; class features ; languages ; and feats . You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature . If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block. No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape- shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast. Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape.

Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction. Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles. Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature.

See \"Spells\" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list.a Druidcraft anda Produce Flame are recommended. Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table. Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list.a Animal Friendship ,a Cure Wounds ,a Faerie Fire , anda Thunderwave are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination. If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. Level 1: Druidic You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have thea Speak with Animals spell prepared. You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic. Level 1: Primal Order You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice. Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor. Level 2: Wild Shape The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action. Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table. Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see \"Creature Stat Blocks\" for stat block options). The Rat , Riding Horse , Spider , and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form. When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed. When choosing known forms, you may look in thea Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so. Beast Shapes Druid Level Known Forms Max CR Fly Speed 2 4 1/4 No 4 6 1/2 No 8 8 1 Yes Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply: Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level. Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block. No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape- shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast. Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form. Level 2: Wild Companion You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast thea Find Familiar spell without Material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest. Level 3: Druid Subclass You gain a Druid subclass of your choice.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Wild Resurgence Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required). In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Level 7: Elemental Fury The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice. Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip. Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit). Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below. Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet. Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended.\\\\n\\\\nWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\\\\n\\\\nSpell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\\\\n\\\\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list.

Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\\\\n\\\\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\\\\n\\\\nChanging Your Prepared Spells.

As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\\\\nNumber of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\\\\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\\\\nKnown Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\\\\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\\\\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.\\\\nBeast Shapes\\\\nDruid Level - Known Forms - Max CR - Fly Speed\\\\n2 - 4 - 1/4 - No\\\\n4 - 6 - 1/2 - No\\\\n8 - 8 - 1 - Yes\\\\nRules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\\\\nTemporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\\\\nGame Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\\\\nNo Spellcasting. You can't cast spells, but shape- shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.\\\\nObjects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.

        "description": "The duel—a battle between two champions with no interference by outsiders—is an ancient tradition of Rokugan dating back to the tournament that decided Hantei’s rule over the newly founded Emerald Empire. As such, since the foundation of Rokugan, duelists have held an important place in Rokugani society. On the battlefield, duelists often take the stage first, or seek out other champions and cut them down even amidst the fray. At court, many courtiers have duelists as bodyguards, not only to protect them from assassins, but also to stand as their champion should a political rival challenge them over some insult. Trials by Combat Members of the samurai class are permitted to duel (or appoint champions to fight for them) should a grievance between two families or individuals grow sufficiently bitter. As a result, any samurai may need to be ready to defend themself or have access to someone who can draw steel to protect their reputation. Duels are also used for certain ceremonies and contests, including the selection of the Emerald Champion, the chief enforcer of law and Imperial decree in the Emerald Empire. As such, training as a duelist may be helpful to certain political aspirations. Many famous commanders are also accomplished duelists, to ensure that if they are intercepted by an assassin or called out to fight by a rival champion on the battlefield, they can vanquish their foe in single combat. Clan Traditions Dueling customs vary by land, and even within the lands of an individual clan. This section presents some of the ways duels are typically fought in certain regions, and how those who specialize in dueling are trained. Crab Clan Traditions. The Crab Clan’s practical ethos of battle generally dictates that duels to the death are a waste of valuable soldiers. However, many members of the Crab Clan nonetheless train in single combat techniques, from wrestling moves to battlefield challenges. The Yasuki family does train more traditional duelists, who are known for guarding merchant caravans and Crab Clan emissaries. Crane Clan Traditions. In Crane lands, legal duels are often fought with swords. As such, the Kakita Duelist Academy emphasizes “one strike, one kill,” seeking for its students to master the one perfect strike, or draw-cut. For this tradition, winning with the most elegant, efficient use of motion is the pinnacle of martial skills, as exemplified in winning a duel with a strike as one unsheathes their blade. The most legendary of living duelists in all of Rokugan, the kenshinzen , are an order within the Kakita Duelist tradition who have achieved a rank of mastery over the draw-cut that few can even conceive, drawing their swords with a fluid speed the swiftest eye can hardly track. These artists of the sword are highly sought-after as bodyguards, advisors, and generals, and the only way to join this elite order is by defeating a kenshinzen in battle in the presence of two other kenshinzen standing as witnesses. Dragon Clan Traditions. The Dragon Clan’s Mirumoto family trains its adepts in the niten, or “Two Heavens” tradition created by the family’s founder, wielding paired weapons such as the katana with the wakizashi or tiger hook swords. This school of swordsmanship emphasizes creativity and flexibility in combat rather than focusing on any single technique, using the terrain and even improvised weapons to full effect to take the day. Some students of the Kitsuki Investigator School also train in the duel as part of their curriculum, seeking insight into the human mind and heart through the clash of blades. Lion Clan Traditions. Battlefield duels are common, and many students of the Matsu Champion tradition are the tested survivors of these heroic clashes. Matsu duelists often dual wield blades or a sword with a knife, presenting two threats at once to harry the defender relentlessly. Alternately, they simply fight with whatever weapon they are currently wielding. Many of the storytellers of the Ikoma family are also duelists in addition to their training as courtiers, needling their enemies with clever words to break their composure and then striking with finality. Phoenix Clan Traditions. Ritualists have their own manner of settling things between aggrieved individuals: spiritual contests in which two ritualists attempt to invoke the same spirit. These contests can serve the same purpose as a duel between ritualists, so most ritualists do not train in dueling with the blade as a result. As such, the Isawa family’s skilled ritualists leave the fighting of martial duels to the disciples of the Shiba Guardian School. Scorpion Clan Traditions. The Scorpion Clan’s duelists are often theatrical, focused not just on cutting down the foe but on making clear the folly of challenging them in the first place. In this way, they use their clan’s fearful reputation to squelch challenges before they are ever delivered. Many shinobi are also trained as duelists, allowing them to cut down even the most skilled target should they isolate them. Unicorn Clan Traditions. In the lands of the Unicorn Clan, archery duels are often the way matters are settled. Sometimes these are competitive hunts, with the winner being the combatant who brings down the best prey. Other times, these are target shooting, or even one-on-one battles with the bow. Wrestling duels are also quite popular within the Unicorn Clan, a tradition inherited from their allies, the Ujik peoples of the Plains of Wind and Stone. Many Utaku Battle Maidens are accomplished duelists in numerous forms, including with the blade, the joust, and the bow. Wandering Blades Some of the greatest duelists to walk Rokugan have been wayfarers on pilgrimages to master a martial art, challenging the most skilled foes they encounter to hone their skills further and win a name for themselves as masters of the blade, spear, bow, or other combat specialty. Such duelists might not be trained in any one formal tradition, or they might have decided that training within the safety of a school’s walls could never give them the insight they need into the art of battle. Others are fleeing something from their past, or something they fear within themselves. For these duelists, the road becomes their mantra. They walk the way of the gleaming blade, the glint of the arrow, the approach of steady resolve. They have honed their skill in their preferred style and have become adept at protecting what they have, for fate has seen fit to bestow them very little but their weapon and their ferocity in battle. Quick Build Generally, make your Dexterity your highest ability score, focusing secondarily on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma based on which archetype you intend to select. A number of iconic duelists of Rokugan can be found in the more detailed quick builds provided in the Backgrounds section, such as the Kakita Blademaster and Mirumoto Adept.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per duelist level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per duelist level after the 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Bowyer’s kit or sword maintenance kit Saving Throws: Dexterity, Wisdom Skills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, and Persuasion. Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted to you by your background: (a) resplendent regalia or (b) traveling clothes or (c) unremarkable garb. (a) any one martial melee weapon or (b) any two light melee weapons or (c) any two identical paired melee weapons or (d) one heavy martial melee weapon or (e) a hunting bow, 20 willow-leaf arrows, 1 armor-piercing arrow, and 1 flesh-cutter arrow. a dagger. (a) bowyer’s kit or (b) sword maintenance kit. Focus Points By understanding the rhythm of battle, you can find the exact right moment to begin pressing an attack, defend, or launch a finishing strike. This clarity in combat grants you access to the focus points that fuel your martial techniques. Your bushi level determines the maximum amount of focus points you can have, as shown in the Focus Maximum column of the Bushi table. Additionally: You start each encounter with 0 focus points. You gain 1 focus point at the end of each of your turns. When you unlock combat stances at 2nd level, you accrue additional focus points at the end of your turn based on your combat stance. At the end of an encounter, unspent focus points are lost. You can’t gain focus points while unconscious. Evasive Footwork You can avoid attacks through prediction, instinct, or cunning manipulation of your foe’s position. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. When you are not wearing armor and not wielding a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity Modifier + the modifier for the ability score you chose. Additionally, while you are dueling, you have a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against any attack made by a creature that is not participating in the duel. Martial Techniques Martial techniques represent exceptional feats of martial prowess that you can perform in place of default combat actions, standard attacks, and reactions. At 1st level, you know the dawn’s grace strike martial technique, detailed below. Dawn's Grace Strike At higher levels, you gain access to additional martial techniques chosen from the list. The number of martial techniques you know increases with your duelist level, as shown in the Martial Techniques column of the Duelist table. You can’t use the same martial technique more than once per turn. Each time you gain a duelist level, you can exchange up to 2 martial techniques you know for other options from the list. You cannot exchange specific martial techniques granted to you by your class or archetype features this way (such as dawn's grace strike). Combat Stance Each stance has different strengths and gives you a specific bonus along with an additional way to gain focus points. You can have only one combat stance active at a time. When you roll initiative, you choose a stance to adopt, and you can switch between stances by spending your full movement or an action. Stances can only be used during combat encounters. Choose two stances you have mastered from the following list: Cormorant Stance You hold yourself ready to throw probing strikes or dive for deadly blow at your foe’s moment of greatest vuln erability. Stance Effects: When you hit with a standard attack or opportunity attack, your target suffers the distracted condition (–2 AC, removed after it is hit by an attack) for 1 minute. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 1 additional focus point for each attack you have made since the end of your last turn. Swallow Stance You set an evasive stance, ready to dart back swiftly at a moment’s notice to exhaust your foes and leave them open to your reprisal. Stance Effects: Attacks of opportunity made against you have disadvantage. Additionally, when attacking a creature that has expended all of its reactions, you gain a bonus to damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 1 additional focus point for each opportunity attack that missed you this turn. Tiger Stance You project aggressive power, preparing for strikes that sweep your foes aside with sh eer force. Stance Effects: When you roll a natural 19 or 20 on an attack roll, you inflict additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make during your turn; this can apply to a multitarget attack roll. Finally, you have a –2 penalty to your Armor Class. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, you gain 3 additional focus points if you inflicted at least one critical hit on a hostile creature this turn. Viper Stance You shift slowly and subtly, maintaining a posture that lets you stay alert to subtle cues in your environment and compensate for injuries you have suffered. Stance Effects: You have advantage (a +5 bonus) on your passive Perception score and on Wisdom saving throws. Additionally, when a negative condition you are suffering would impose disadvantage on any check, saving throw, or attack roll you make, you make that roll without advantage or disadvantage. Focus Generation: At the end of your turn, gain 2 additional focus points if you are suffering at least one negative condition or have at least one danger die assigned to you, and 1 additional focus point per condition or danger die beyond the first. Lethal Instinct Starting at 2nd level, you can detect the subtle ebbs and flows of the duel that leave one combatant dead and the other standing, their blade running red. After the staredown at the start of the round during a duel, you can use this feature to gain focus points equal to the number danger dice assigned to you, to a maximum of your duelist level or your proficiency bonus (whichever is lower). After you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest. Starting at 15th level, you regain the use of this feature whenever you win a duel. Challenge of Steel Starting at 3rd level, you can attempt to draw an enemy in a combat encounter into a duel with you. Once on your turn as a free action, you can issue your challenge targeting one creature that can perceive you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw with DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On success, it can choose whether or not to enter the duel. On failure, it must duel you, and starts that duel with danger dice equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). See Duels for more information on integrating a duel into a skirmish. After you enter a duel using this feature, you cannot use it again until you win that duel or complete a short or long rest. Duelist Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that determines your way of fighting. Choose Blademaster, Adept, or Deathdancer, detailed at the end of this class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 13th level, and increases to four at 20th level. Decisive Blade Starting at 6th level, your finesse in the art of the deathmatch becomes even more refined. When you perform a finishing blow against an opponent and roll the danger dice that opponent has been assigned, you can reroll all dice with a result of 1 or 2 and must use the new result, even if it is a 1 or 2. At 14th level, you can reroll all dice with a result of 1, 2, or 3 instead and must use the result even if it is a 1, 2, or 3. At 17th level, for each danger die with a result of 6 or higher before rerolling, you can roll one additional danger die and add it to the result. These additional dice cannot be rerolled or add further results. Swift Evasion Starting at 9th level, your combat instincts let you evade hits or pursue fleeing foes with practiced speed. On your turn, you can spend a bonus action to perform a Dodge action. After you perform a Dodge action, your movement speed is increased by 10 feet until the end of your turn. Additional Combat Stance Starting at 10th level, you master one additional combat stance of your choice from the duelist list. Duelist Archetypes Duelists may all pursue mastery in single combat, but different types of duelists approach this with varied mindsets, philosophies, and approaches. Certain traditions are best reflected by certain archetypes, such as the precise Kakita Duelist being reflected in the Blademaster or the wily Mirumoto Adept being reflected in the Adept. However, even if a character is trained in a particular tradition, their player might decide to have them pursue any of the three archetypes to reflect their duelist’s unique style.

A promethean soldier transmits silent commands to an army of nanomachines designed to seal the wounds of his fellow officers. Engineers are espers who make use of modern day inventions, robotics, computers, and chemistry. Combined with the use of sorium, their technical skills are open to an infinite realm of possibilities. Their personalized rig translates their thoughts into streams of data that weave into system commands. No matter their path, they constantly improve by focusing on their training, tools, and technical know-how to defy the odds. Masters of Science Engineers devote themselves to a particular path of study, often viewing the universe and the living creatures within it in a very technical sense. Their awakened intuition allows them to see the structural patterns and connections between all things, almost as if the universe were written in a code only they can read. The rise of many cosmic threats, both organic and inorganic, has led many an engineer down the path of a defender of worlds. Viral plagues, rogue mechanical beasts, and nefarious cybercriminals are just a few examples of what they stand against. Engineers tend to keep in contact with others of their field of study, forming scientific local or online groups. A Fusion of Forces Engineers have access to a vast array of materials, all forged or powered by sorium, the mysterious energy harvested from the Crucibles. An internal sorium implant, most often placed near the brain, grants them both a physical and neural link to their arsenal of tools. Through the use of a form of esper power known as Forging, an engineer is able to manipulate these resources, instantly crafting nanobots, assault and medical drones, and plasma weapons. These techniques can also directly alter or deconstruct matter and provide bio-enhancements to themselves or their allies. Creating an Engineer When you create your Engineer, think about what sort of scientific profession your character would follow. Would they study biology or chemistry? Or perhaps their study focuses more on physical mechanics. How or why did you choose to delve into this field? Is it connected to your character’s history or personality? Ability Scores It is recommended you make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Intelligence is also useful for many of your skills.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per engineer level Hit Points at 1st Level : 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per engineer level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: One artisan tool or Vehicle Proficiency (you choose) Saving Throws: Constitution, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Astrophysics, Computers, Insight, Lore, Mechanics, Medicine, Persuasion, and Xenobiology Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a short blade or (b) wrist blades, or (c) an energy staff (a) light trooper armor, (b) medium trooper armor, or (c) heavy trooper armor (if proficient) (a) a light pistol and 15 shots of ammunition, or (b) any simple weapon (a) a scientist’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack (a) an engineer’s rig Forging Your tools and training allow you to perform various techniques to produce astonishing effects. Prime Talents At 1st level, you know three prime techniques of your choice from the engineer’s techniques list. You learn additional talents at higher levels as shown in the Prime Techniques column of the Engineer table. Forging and the Engineer’s Rig Each engineer has a set of tools and materials they use to employ their special powers. Often referred to as a “rig”, it comes in various forms but is almost always the size of a small pack or box. Every engineer is fitted with an implant that allows them to communicate directly with their rig. Aside from tools, there are two features that are universal amongst all rigs. Raw Sorium: Each rig has a small supply of raw sorium, which not only supplies power to several of the rig’s operations, it also allows the engineer to craft alchemical and mechanical materials on the fly to serve as the components required for their more powerful techniques. It is in limited supply, but much like weapons powered by sorium cores, the raw material regenerates after a period of time. Micro-Drones: Each rig has a set of coin-sized, spherical drones that the engineer controls directly. Though not always used, the drone is an invaluable tool that can multitask with the engineer and produce effects at a distance. Crafted from pure sorium, they can take on whichever color or texture the engineer chooses. They are hard to hit and destroy, but are easily replaceable if such a situation arises. Forging Preparation The Engineer table shows how many tech slots you have to use your techniques of Rank 1 and higher. To use one of these techniques, you must expend a slot of the technique’s level or higher. The tech slots represent the supply of raw sorium and equipment available to power your techniques. You regain all expended tech slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare a list of engineer techniques that are available for you to use, choosing from the engineer powers list. When you do so, choose a number of engineer techniques equal to your Wisdom modifier + your engineer level (minimum of one technique). The techniques must be of a level for which you have tech slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level engineer, you have four Rank 1 and two Rank 2 tech slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared techniques can include six techniques of Ranks 1 and 2, in any combination. If you prepare the Rank 1 mend technique, you can use it by expending a Rank 1 or Rank 2 slot. Using this technique doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared techniques. You can change your list of prepared techniques when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of techniques requires time spent in building and allocating resources. This should take at least 1 minute per technique rank for each technique on your list. Forging Ability Wisdom is your forging ability for your engineer techniques. A tool is useless without the proper judgment on where to use it. An engineer’s forte is not just based on knowledge, but on being able to use that knowledge effectively, timely, and reserved manner. You use your Wisdom whenever a technique refers to your forging ability. In addition, you use you Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a technique you use and when making an attack roll with one. Forging save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Forging attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Conventional Forging You can use a technique conventionally if the technique has the conventional tag and you have the technique prepared. Technical Specialty Choose one specialty with which you focus your skills as an engineer. Each specialty is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you specific abilities when you choose it at 1st level, as well as additional abilities 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level. Specialty Techniques Each specialty also comes with associated techniques that you gain at the levels noted in the specialty description. Once you gain a specialty technique, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of techniques you can prepare each day. Call Rig At 1st level, you can use your implant to remain in contact with your rig at all times. With your reaction, you can sense the general location of your rig as long as it is within 500 miles of you. You can sense the direction and can confirm the exact distance once you’re within 1000 feet. Regardless of distance, you can use your bonus action and expend a tech slot to call upon your rig to phase shift instantly into your hand. Once you reach 5th level, summoning your rig no longer requires you to expend a tech slot. If your rig is permanently lost or destroyed, you can forge a new one by spending 8 hours of time and 500 cu in materials. This can be performed during a long rest. Once a new rig is forged, your previous rig ceases to function and becomes a set of cybersmith’s tools. Rig Expansion At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use the raw energy in your rig to fuel additional effects. You start with two such effects: Electromagnetic Pulse and an effect that is defined by your specialty. Depending on your specialty, you may gain additional effects as you gain in level. When you use your Rig Expansion, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Rig Expansion again. Some Rig Expansion effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your technician Forging save DC. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Rig Expansion twice between rests and three times at 18th level. Rig Expansion: Electromagnetic Pulse As an action, you use your rig to send an explosive wave of electromagnetic energy that debilitates and disorients robots, drones, and any creature with the automaton or construct creature type. Each of these targets within 30 feet of you and with less than three-quarters cover must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the target fails its saving throw, it is impaired until the end of your next turn or until it takes any damage. This ability also affects mechanical creatures controlled by a live operator. An impaired target cannot take any reactions and its movement is reduced to 0. The only action available to the target is the dodge action. In addition, any unshielded computer panel or electronic device not worn by another creature is rendered inert until the start of your next turn. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Mechanical Devastation At 5th level, when an automaton or construct fails its saving throw against your Electromagnetic Pulse feature, it is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the following table. Engineer Level Destroys targets of CR... 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower The Jury Rig Beginning at 10th level, you can instinctively commune with your rig to devise some form of aid in a dire situation when you’re in desperate need of one. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your engineer level, you instinctively come up with an on the fly effect to assist you. The GM chooses the nature of this benefit; often in the form of an effect generated by an engineer technique or specialty power. If your roll is successful, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, your rig provides you with assistance automatically, no roll required. Technical Specialties Engineers come in all types, each devoted to a particular field of study in which they specialize. These specialty fields provide the engineer with additional abilities that correspond with their chosen path. Where Engineer is a broad term, your specialty is what defines how others view your expertise as well as your title. Your choice of specialty may also be considered your career if you so choose. Engineers are considered a necessity for many of the different societies scattered throughout the galaxy. Some even establish trade centers from which to offer goods and services.

        "description": "A human in clanging plate armor⁠ holds her shield⁠ before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor⁠, peppers the goblins with arrows⁠ loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage. A dwarf in chain mail⁠ interposes his shield⁠ between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses. A gladiator⁠ fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident⁠ and net, skilled⁠ at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him. All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons⁠ & Dragons . Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit⁠ kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons⁠ and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat⁠. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face. Well-Rounded Specialists Fighters learn the basics of all combat⁠ styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike. Trained for Danger Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran⁠ soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters. Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common⁠ among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example. Creating a Fighter As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat⁠ training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors. You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics⁠, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace. Quick Build You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.

Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield⁠. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Second Wind You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Action Surge Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn. Martial Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat⁠ styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. Indomitable Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level. Martial Archetypes Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. Improved Critical Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor.

Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.

        "description": "A glass falls, clattering to the floor, and the tavern grows silent. A dwarf with a deep scowl, dripping with freshly spilled beer, leers at a nearby drunken orc and fingers for a pair of revolvers at his waist. High on a hillside, carefully concealed beneath foliage and stones, a marksman steadies her breathing and adjusts her scope, acquiring her target and waiting for the moment to strike. Risk is in a gunslinger’s blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive. Guts and Gunpowder Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Unlike a sword or a bow, a firearm can explode in your hands, and its ammunition turns into a bomb whenever it catches a spark. Only the truly mad or eerily stalwart choose to become gunslingers. Gunslingers hurl death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Whenever they draw their weapons, life or death hangs in the balance, hinging on their guts, snap decision-making, and quick aim. Dangerous Outsiders A gunslinger’s explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude that earns them few friends and plentiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and go to great lengths to remain incognito, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle. Yet their skills are always in demand. Anyone seeking protection or revenge can count on a gunslinger when they roll into town. After all, gunslingers often pick up odd jobs to make ends meet, and they have one truly marketable skill. Creating a Gunslinger When creating your gunslinger, consider where firearms fit in the campaign’s world and the common perceptions of those who use them. If firearms are the norm, your gunslinger might be a mercenary or militia fighter. If firearms are rare, your gunslinger might be one of a kind, a trailblazer in new types of warfare. It’s also not unusual for a gunslinger to be haunted by their past. Did some event drive you to the gun and motivate you to travel? Is there a bounty on your head in one or more regions? Do you have old enemies that seek you for revenge? Quick Build To make a gunslinger quickly, follow these suggestions. Make Dexterity and Constitution your highest ability scores. If you plan to choose the Gun Tank creed, instead make Strength your highest ability score. Lastly, choose any background, preferably one that emphasizes your familiarity with firearms and penchant for risk-taking. These folks sling guns, as opposed to those folks over there who sling axes.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per gunslinger level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per gunslinger level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, simple firearms, martial firearms Tools: One type of gaming set Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma Skills: Choose two from: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: Leather armor with a longcoat A dagger and (a) a handgun and 20 bullets or (b) a revolver and 10 bullets Any two-handed firearm that isn’t heavy and 30 bullets or shells (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack Fighting Style You adopt a particular style of gunfighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Akimbo When you engage in two-weapon fighting with firearms, you don’t take a penalty to the damage of the second attack. Bullseye You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make with firearms. The weapon must have the Sighted property or have a normal range of 80 feet or longer to gain this benefit. This benefit doesn’t stack with the Archery fighting style. Duelist While you are wielding a firearm in one hand and nothing in the other, if you make a ranged weapon attack and exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more, you deal one extra die of weapon damage. You can only use this ability once per round. Shotgunner When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using a firearm that has the Scatter property, you can reroll the lowest damage die, and you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is worse than the original. Quick Draw Gunslingers have twitch reflexes and can pull a gun in the blink of an eye. You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, you can draw or stow up to two weapons when you roll initiative and whenever you take an action on your turn. Critical Shot At 2nd level, your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Starting at 9th level, your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20, and at 17th level your ranged firearm attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 17–20. Poker Face Starting at 2nd level, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to prevent others from sensing your motives, perceiving your emotions, or reading your thoughts. Risk By 2nd level, you can perform incredible feats of daring that are fueled by special dice called risk dice. Risk Dice You have four risk dice, which are d8s. You gain additional risk dice, and your risk dice change as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Risk Dice column of the Gunslinger table. You regain all expended risk dice when you finish a long rest. Using Risk Dice Once per turn, you can expend a risk die to perform a deed of your choice. Your deed options are detailed at the end of the class description. Saving Throws Some of your deeds require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deed’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Deed save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier Gunslinger’s Creed By the time gunslingers reach 3rd level, they embrace a way of living, known as their creed, which guides their judgments and their unique brand of gunslinging. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. I’m so glad mortals keep inventing new ways of killing one another Gut Shot Starting at 6th level, whenever you score a critical hit against a Large or smaller creature with a ranged firearm attack, the bullet lodges itself in the target. Until the creature uses its action to dislodge the bullet, it moves at half speed and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Elementals, Oozes, and Undead are immune to this effect. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Mankiller Starting at 11th level, when you use your action to make ranged firearm attacks, you can add your ability modifier to the firearm’s damage rolls. Note that firearms don’t normally add your ability modifier to their damage rolls. Dire Gambit Beginning at 13th level, whenever you score a critical hit, you regain one expended risk die. Cheat Death By 15th level, you have a knack for evading the grave. When you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you can use your reaction and expend one risk die to remain standing. You instead drop to a number of hit points equal to the number rolled on the die. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Maverick By 18th level, you have become unshakable. You have advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. Head Shot At 20th level, when you score a critical hit against a creature with a firearm, you can choose for the shot to be a head shot. If the creature has less than 100 hit points, it dies. Otherwise, it takes an extra 10d10 damage from the hit. Elementals, Oozes, Undead, and creatures that lack nervous systems or vital organs take no extra damage from this feature. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Deeds The deeds are presented in alphabetical order. Bite the Bullet As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one risk die to gain temporary hit points equal the number rolled on the die + your Constitution modifier. Covering Fire When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action to cow the creature. Roll the risk die and subtract it from the next attack roll the creature makes before the start of your next turn. Dodge Roll You can expend one risk die as a bonus action to move up to 15 feet and reload any firearm you are holding. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, ignores difficult terrain, and allows you to move through a hostile creature’s space, as long as you don’t end your movement there. Limb Shot When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one risk die as a bonus action and aim for one of its limbs, attempting to force it to drop one item of your choice that it is holding. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose, which lands at its feet. Skin of Your Teeth When an attacker you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can expend a risk die as a reaction to dodge out of harm’s way at the last second. You add the risk die to your AC against this attack, potentially causing it to miss. Steady Aim On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one risk die to double the normal and maximum range for the next ranged weapon attack you make. Gunslinger’s Creeds Gunslingers have many features in common, but each of them walks their own path and follows their own code. This code, which gunslingers call a creed, embodies their core beliefs and informs their unique combat style. Gunslinger Creeds Name Description Gun Tank Lugs around heavy mounted firearms Gun-Ko Master A martial artist who uses the gun as a total weapon High Roller Gambles with their life and fortune; no risk is too high Musketeer A musket-and-rapier-wielding soldier of honor and courage Pistolero Fires six-shooters from the hip at incredible speed Sharpshooter A careful and precise, eagle-eyed marksman Spellslinger Fires spells as well as bullets in deadly bombardments Trick Shot Ricochets bullets to hit targets from any angle White Hat A law-abiding protector of the weak that never blinks in the face of danger",

        "name": "Hunter",
        "description": "Moving swiftly through the shadows, a promethean hunter stalks his bounty through the city streets, patiently waiting for them to reach his planned point of ambush. Dropping down onto the narrow platform, an ashenforged peers through the steam-filled chamber for her mark. Her senses kick in, rolling sideways to avoid the mecharoid’s laser fire. She spins about and pulls her rifle in a single motion, aiming for the machine’s sensor eye. A valna taps his visual display, receiving a location signal from his hunter drone. Its target has been found. Steeling himself, the hunter makes his way along the wasteland’s tainted earth, signaling his drone to circle around for a pincer attack. From crowded city streets to the harsh conditions of a lifeless planet, hunters are masters of tracking and confronting their targets anywhere, anytime. When not pursuing a mark, they can be staunch defenders of any territory. Tasks Less Ordinary Many hunters hold a reputation for taking on the jobs that no one else wants. In addition to being skilled combatants, they are expert trackers and resourceful investigators. Each one has their own method of operation, often centered on a bit of craftiness, stealthy pursuits, and tactical surprises. Regardless of the territory, enemies, or obstacles, the best of hunters stop at nothing until they accomplish the task set before them. This often earns them reputations garnering both fear and a begrudging respect from allies and enemies alike. Security and Survival A hunter’s success is defined by skill in their trade, though there are few similarities as to how they choose to make their living. Some are protectorates of a particular territory or populace, such as a police officer or sentry. Others make their way as bounty hunters, working solo or as a member of a guild. Some still join the military as scouts and tacticians. This level of self-reliance also means hunters choose their allies and companions carefully, as sometimes the survival of the squad may come down to the hunter as the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. Creating a Hunter As you create your hunter, consider how they use their skills in their everyday life. Is it tied to a particular profession? Are they a bounty hunter or perhaps just a wandering survivalist? Then, choose where they learned their skills and how they’ve come to apply them with their abilities as an esper. Did they achieve esper genesis at a young age and master their skills afterward, or did it perhaps happen in reverse when they began as a scout who suddenly became attuned? You should also decide on your chosen type of enemy. What is the connection between you and your specialized choice of prey? Was your life or one of someone important to you ruined by machines? Was your home destroyed by beasts? Were you always exceptional at tracking and confronting the criminal element? Ability Scores Dexterity should be your highest ability score followed by Wisdom. Strength is useful for some melee combatants and to offset recoil for larger firearms.

Hit Points Hit Dice : 1d10 per hunter level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per hunter level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Disguise kit or Vehicles (Planetary) Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity Skills: Choose three from Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Xenobiology Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) military jacket or (b) armor jacket (a) two simple melee weapons or (b) two shortblades or (c) arm pistol with 12 shots of ammunition (a) a soldier’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack (a) an autopistol or (b) an autorifle (a) a hunter’s rig Expert Wayfarer At 1st level, you are trained to always mind your surroundings, and you react swiftly when faced with a threat. This grants you the following benefits: You ignore difficult terrain. You have advantage on initiative rolls. On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling in a particular area for at least one hour: Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. Your group can’t become lost unless through non-mundane means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as navigating, searching, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. If you are in a location or structure with multiple floors or levels, you can tell which level you are on. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. Know Your Target At 1st level, you study and plan ahead when pursuing a certain type of foe chosen as your quarry. Choose a type of quarry to pursue: aberrations, automatons, beasts, constructs, cyborgs, dragons, golems, proteans, monstrosities, netherants, plants, or primordials. Alternatively you can choose two types of humanoid (such as Aluphax, Lorendi, or Matokai). You gain the following benefits. You have advantage to Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your chosen enemies. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Lore) check or Intelligence (Xenobiology) check to recall information about your chosen quarry, you are considered proficient in both Lore and Xenobiology and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Intimidation) rolls when dealing with your quarry. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made when hiding from your quarry. You can choose a new type of quarry when you complete a long rest, after which the benefits of the previous quarry type are lost. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Gunnery When you are wielding a firearm with the recoil property, that firearm’s recoil value is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of zero). Point Shooting When making a ranged weapon attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Sharpshooting You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Forging When you reach 2nd level, you can attune yourself to a hunter’s rig, which allows you to perform various techniques to produce astonishing effects. Hunter’s Rig You have a personalized set of sorium materials and micro-drones, often referred to as a rig, which is used to activate and implement your techniques. You are fitted with an implant that allows you to communicate directly with your rig. A hunter’s rig usually takes the form of a utility belt, a small carrying case, a pack expansion, or an armor attachment. With your reaction, you can sense the general location of your rig as long as it is within 500 miles of you. You can sense the direction and can confirm the exact distance once you’re within 1000 feet. Regardless of distance, you can use your bonus action and expend a tech slot to call upon your rig to phase shift instantly into your hand. At 5th level, summoning your rig no longer requires you to expend a tech slot. If your rig is permanently lost or destroyed, you can forge a new one by spending 8 hours of time and 500 cu in materials. This can be performed during a long rest. Once a new rig is forged, your previous rig ceases to function and becomes a set of ordinary survival supplies. Tech Slots The Hunter table shows how many tech slots you have to use for techniques. To activate a technique, you must expend a tech slot of the technique’s rank or higher. You regain all expended tech slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the rank 1 technique sensory jammer and have a rank 1 and a rank 2 tech slot available, you can use sensory jammer using either slot. Powers Known of Rank 1 and Higher You know two rank 1 techniques of your choice from the hunter powers list. The Techniques Known column of the Hunter table shows when you learn more hunter techniques. Each of these techniques must be of a rank for which you have tech slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new rank 1 or rank 2 technique. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hunter techniques you know and replace it with another technique from the hunter powers list, which also must be of a level for which you have tech slots. Forging Ability Wisdom is your forging ability for your hunter techniques, calling upon your instincts and expertise to implement your powers. You use your Wisdom whenever a technique refers to your forging ability. In addition, you use you Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a technique you use and when making an attack roll with one. Forging save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Forging attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Hunter’s Mark Starting at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to scan a creature and mark it for pursuit and subdual. Choose a creature within 90 feet that you can see. You deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target when you hit it with a weapon attack. If the target is a favored quarry (see the Favored Quarry feature) or one currently chosen from the Know Your Target feature, the extra damage increases to 1d8. In addition, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find the target, regardless of their creature type. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on an esper power). If the target drops to 0 hit points before the effects of this feature ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Hunter Archetype At 3rd level, you choose to adopt a particular set of practices that define your trade as a hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Objective Scanner Beginning at 3rd level, you expand the use of your rig to aid in tracking your quarry. To do so, you spend a tech slot and spend one uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if concentrating on an esper power). Once you do so, you learn whether any creatures of your chosen quarry type is present within 10 miles of your location. This feature reveals the type of quarry present, how many there are if in a group, and their general direction and distance from you (in miles). If you detect multiple groups of your quarry type within range, you receive separate information for each group. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Favored Quarry At 6th level, you gain significant experience studying, tracking, and hunting a certain type of quarry. Ideally, your choice should reflect the types of threats you’ve encountered throughout your career as a hunter. Choose a creature type available from the Know Your Target feature. You gain all the benefits for this chosen quarry that you would normally gain against one from the Know Your Target feature. The benefits gained against this quarry type do not expire. You can also choose a new type of quarry with the Know Your Target feature without losing the benefits gained against your favored quarry. In addition, when you gain this feature, you learn one language of your choice. This can be any language you wish, though typically it would be one spoken by your favored quarry or other creatures associated with it. Fast Movement Starting at 8th level, when you’re not wearing heavy armor, you can use the dash action as a bonus action during your turn. Hide in Plain Sight Beginning at 10th level, you can camouflage yourself by remaining still within your surroundings. When you attempt to hide on your turn and do not move on that turn, your proficiency bonus is doubled when you make your Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide. If you are not proficient in Stealth, you instead add your proficiency bonus to your normal roll. Until the start of your next turn, creatures that attempt to detect you take a penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks equal to half your hunter level rounded down. You lose this benefit if you move, fall prone, take an action or reaction, or some other effect causes you to no longer be hidden. If you are still hidden and do not move on your next turn, you continue to gain this benefit until you are detected. Vanish Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by mundane means, neither physically nor digitally, unless you choose to leave a trail. Blind Fighting At 18th level, you gain intuitive combat senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened. Slayer At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored quarries or one currently chosen by the Know Your Target feature. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. Hunter Archetypes At 3rd level, a hunter gains the Hunter’s Archetype feature. Your choice represents your tradecraft by which you operate and utilize your abilities. Some hunters specialize in subduing and killing an enemy, making them effective at collecting bounties and contracts. Others focus on their skills in shadowing and investigation, making for a skilled tracker or guardian. Mechinor Stalker Vanguard",

        "description": "The archdevils who rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme and plot endlessly, eternally. Each seeks to bring the others to heel. To ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the seven cities and every infernal thing that lives there, and lead an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn. Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the illriggers. Knights of Hell, they are charismatic counter-paladins who master devils, disrupt enemy organizations, and command Hell’s armies. The Order of Desolation Millennia ago, the Lords of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. They came together to create the Order of Desolation, knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second. Acceptance into the Order of Desolation makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil you serve. Each archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But this association of illriggers consider themselves above the petty political squabbles that divide the seven cities. Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult might conclude that the presence of an illrigger in their midst is a sign that their archdevil approves of their actions, but the illriggers are independent. The order was founded to give the Lords of Hell agents capable of acting across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron. An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron’s trust. Left to their own devices, the illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision. It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to rely on other members of the order first, even from illriggers who serve other archdevils, before going to any church, cult, or temple devoted to their own archdevil. Class Features As an illrigger, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d10 per illrigger level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per illrigger level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution, Charisma Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Persuasion, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons (a) chain shirt or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows (a) a priest’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack A holy symbol, two daggers, and five javelins Level Proficiency Bonus Features Infernal Conduit Dice 1st +2 Forked Tongue, Infernal Conduit 1 2nd +2 Fighting Style, Baleful Interdict 1 3rd +2 Hellsight, Diabolic Contract 2 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 2 5th +3 Extra Attack 3 6th +3 Baleful Interdict Improvement 3 7th +3 Diabolic Contract Improvement 4 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 4 9th +4 Diabolic Contract Improvement 5 10th +4 Baleful Interdict Improvement 5 11th +4 Improved Infernal Conduit 6 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 6 13th +5 Diabolic Contract Improvement 7 14th +5 Aura of Despair 7 15th +5 Summon Hell 8 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 8 17th +6 Diabolic Contract Improvement 9 18th +6 Baleful Interdict Improvement 9 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 10 20th +6 Infernal Contract Improvement 10 Multiclassing An existing character choosing to multiclass into illrigger must meet the following prerequisites: Charisma 13 and Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 You gain the following proficiencies when you choose illrigger as a new class: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons. Multiclass characters divide their illrigger levels by three for the purposes of determining how many spell slots they get. This may result in an Architect of Ruin losing a spell level, but Asmodeus takes a dim view of Illriggers who stray from strict commitment to the path of Hell. Forked Tongue You have a facility with speech and know how to manipulate an audience. Whenever you make an ability check to persuade, deceive, or intimidate, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8. Additionally you learn the Infernal language. Infernal Conduit There is a pool of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. This pool is represented by dice, starting with 1d10 at 1st level. Your pool gains dice as shown on the Illrigger table. With these dice you can transfer hit points between your illrigger and other targets, healing allies at the expense of your own health or draining the life force of enemies to rejuvenate your own vitality. As an action, choose a number of dice from your remaining pool and touch another creature. If they are unwilling, this is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. If you miss, nothing happens—you do not roll or lose dice from your pool. If you hit, or if you’re targeting a willing creature, roll the chosen dice. The result of your roll is the number of hit points you transfer. If you’re touching an ally, they gain that many hit points, ignoring any hit points in excess of their maximum. You lose hit points equal to the number of hit points they gained. If your sacrifice reduces you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious. If you’re touching an enemy, they take necrotic damage equal to your roll, and you gain that many hit points. If you would gain hit points in excess of your maximum, you gain that number of temporary hit points instead. Beginning at 11th level, in addition to draining the life force of an enemy, you can also inflict one level of exhaustion on them. They may recover this exhaustion normally. This ability does not work if the target already has three or more levels of exhaustion, or if you have no dice left in your pool, and you cannot choose to inflict exhaustion instead of draining life. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you choose an illrigger fighting style: Treachery When you attack an enemy who has none of your allies adjacent to it, you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls. Bravado While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. Schemes While you wield a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you can use your reaction after an adjacent enemy attacks you to move into any other unoccupied space within five feet of the attacking enemy. This movement does not provoke an opportunity attack. Lies When you attack with a two-handed melee weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, for both the attack and damage rolls. Baleful Interdict When you reach 2nd level, you learn to use the power of Hell to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, you can place a seal on a target you can see within 30 feet. You can do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all your seals. When you or an ally hits a target you can see with any seals on it, you can consume the seals to make the attack deal an extra 2d6 necrotic damage to the target per seal consumed. If you are within 30 feet of the target, you regain 2 hit points for each die of damage your seals deals. A creature with a seal on them is an interdicted creature. Seals evaporate if not used after 1 minute. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there; it appears to the illrigger as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead. If a creature with any of your seals on it dies, you can move all of its seals to another creature within range. When you reach 10th level, you feel your connection to your archdevil increase. Your seals deal an extra 1d6 damage. Your seals improve differently based on which contract you choose. These improvements are listed under “Diabolic Contract,” below. Hellsight When you reach 3rd level, your mastery of deception makes it easy for you to recognize the use of concealing sorcery. As an action, you extend your awareness out from you. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures within 60 feet using magic to hide or disguise themselves. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses. Diabolic Contract When you reach 3rd level, you sign a diabolic contract with your archdevil who welcomes you into the Order of Desolation. You gain the Invoke Authority ability and choose either Painkiller (Dispater), Shadowmaster (Moloch), or Architect of Ruin (Asmodeus) as your archdevil. Furthermore, you are a noble knight in the lists of Hell and will be accorded fine treatment and hospitality anywhere in Hell you travel, even to cities ruled by enemy archdevils. More cosmopolitan cities in the timescape—like Alloy, the City of Brass—will also respect your noble rank. Invoke Authority You invoke the authority granted you by your archdevil, channelling baleful energy to fuel magical effects. Each Invoke Authority option provided by your archdevil explains how to use it. When you use your Invoke Authority, you choose which option to use. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest to use it again. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Aura of Despair Beginning at 14th level, you radiate a magical aura of evil. Whenever a hostile creature within 15 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the result. Summon Hell Beginning at 15th level, as an action, you can summon a bone devil to serve you for 1 minute. The devil appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. It is bound to you and must obey your commands to the best of its ability. It acts on the same initiative that you act on, and may both act and move on the turn you summon it. If you die or fall unconscious, the devil returns to Hell. Once you use this feature, you must wait 1 week before you can use it again. Diabolic Contracts The knight who walks the path of Hell may gain access to the powers of the Illrigger purely through their own devotion. No oath is necessary, no mentor. A fledgling hellknight might not even be aware Hell’s Paladins exist. But acceptance into the Order of Desolation at 3rd level means swearing an oath to a specific Lord of Hell and this usually requires a senior member of the order to perform an elaborate ritual. A dedicated knight, however, can attract the attention of one of the Infernal Dukes by doing deeds of great treachery on their own. Through ritual or deed, the young Illrigger eventually finds themselves face-to-face with one of the Lords of the Seven Cities…and the Contract must be signed. The contract that binds the itinerant knight to the Order and adds their names to the Lists of Hell. A contract signed in blood. Usually the knight’s. As intimidating an experience as this can be, the Lords of Hell are easy masters. They ask little from their chosen. Breaches of tenets are overlooked, as long as the knight sows discord and opposes the Celestial Host. The Dukes of the Seven Cities are busy and do not worry overmuch about the daily lives of their Illriggers. Indeed, this is what the order is for. Advancing Hell’s agenda, independent of the current political climate of the Seven Cities. Painkiller Shadowmaster Architect of Ruin",

        "name": "Investigator",
        "description": "A collage of diagrams, maps, and small items litters the wall, pinned with nails and connected by a spiderweb of colorful strings. An elf stands nearby, contemplating the mystery splayed out in front of her and readying her crossbow for work. A half-orc wearing a wide-brimmed hat leafs through a thick tome, double-checking the supplies: a sturdy net trap, holy symbols on the doors, cloves of garlic, and several dozen wooden stakes. The preparations made, the half-orc slinks into the shadows and readies himself for the bloodshed. Blood dripping from its fangs and claws, a monstrously fat demon bears down on a human, who busies herself marking a tavern’s door frame with a few chalkmark runes. She takes a long step back and waits. As the demon lunges for its next meal, an invisible force lashes forth from the doorway, lopping off its hand and raking its stomach. The fiend howls with rage, and the inquisitor breathes a sigh of relief. Supernatural detectives and monster slayers, investigators are always on the hunt for malevolent outsiders. Whenever evil seeps into the world—be it fiends, undead, or strange abominations from beyond the stars—investigators will be the first to locate them and banish their foul corruption from the mortal plane. Paranormal Investigators There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands on a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night. Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake. Exorcists and Occultists Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters’ powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams—everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator’s occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire’s fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs. Creating an Investigator As you build your investigator, consider what sort of supernatural threat first drove you to investigating and combating the occult. Did one of your family members strike a bargain with a fiend? Were you kidnapped by a cabal of vampires or a pack of lycanthropes? Did you stumble across evidence of an eldritch abomination, such as a Great Old One? The type of creature you first did battle with likely shaped your tools and methods later on. Did you apprentice under a seasoned monster hunter, learning the ropes of tracking a threat, uncovering its weaknesses, and setting a trap for it? Or did you strike out on your own, compiling your own grimoire from hard-earned research? Perhaps you learned everything about monster hunting from someone else’s grimoire, a masterwork containing an abridged library of occult knowledge and a lifetime of experience. It’s even possible that you signed a contract with a minor fiend and turned to supernatural investigation in a last-ditch effort to save your soul. Quick Build Follow these suggestions to build an investigator quickly: Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength. Then, select the rituals clue, comprehend languages, detect magic, and transient bulwark to add to your grimoire. Finally, pick any background, preferably one that relates to your experience with supernatural monsters and the occult.

At 6th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. Ritualist You maintain a grimoire brimming with magical rituals: your most potent tools to defeat supernatural threats. Grimoire At 1st level, you have a grimoire containing four 1st-level spells of your choice that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the spells needn’t be from the same list). You can’t cast spells that are in your grimoire except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can add an additional ritual spell from the Investigator Spells list (see Chapter 6) to your grimoire at no cost. The Ritual Level column on the Investigator table shows the maximum spell level you can add to your grimoire. Additionally, whenever you find a ritual spell on your adventures, you can add it to your grimoire if it is on the investigator spell list and is of a level you can add to your grimoire. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. Bonus Rituals As an investigator, you can treat specific spells as if they had the ritual tag, allowing you to add them to your grimoire and cast them as rituals. These spells are marked in the investigator spell list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your ritual spells, since you master your spells through deduction and cunning. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, when you cast an investigator ritual or a spell offered to you by a feature in this class, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC and making an attack roll. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier As a thing-that-goes-bump-in-the-night, I find this whole career path offensive. Myths and Legends At 2nd level, you are extremely adept at uncovering knowledge that pertains to eldritch threats and forgotten legends. You have advantage on Intelligence checks related to researching creatures, spells, and other ancient or secret lore. Rushed Incantation Beginning at 2nd level, you can hastily perform any ritual spell in your grimoire that has a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, completing the ritual as a bonus action. If the spell requires material components worth 100 gp or less, you can cast it without providing those components. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. As you gain higher levels in this class, you can use this feature additional times. You can use it once more at 5th level (Intelligence modifier + 1), 9th level (Intelligence modifier + 2), 13th level (Intelligence modifier + 3), and 17th level (Intelligence modifier + 4). Occult Specialization At 3rd level, you choose a specialization, an area of expertise in handling eldritch threats. Specializations are detailed at the end of the class description. Your specialization choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Trinkets Investigators also collect a number of supernatural trinkets. You must be holding a trinket to activate it. Once you use one of your trinkets, you can’t use any of them again until you finish a short or long rest. As you gain higher levels in this class, you can use your trinkets additional times between rests: You can use them once more at 5th level (2 uses), 11th level (3 uses), and 17th level (4 uses). Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Exploit Weakness Most supernatural creatures have some form of weakness, a gap in their armor that allows them to be defeated. Starting at 5th level, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the target is treated as if it has vulnerability to the weapon’s damage. Vulnerability from this feature only doubles your weapon’s damage roll and your ability modifier; you don’t double extra damage from sources like spells (such as hunter’s mark ), magic items (such as the extra fire damage of a flame tongue ), feats, or class features (such as Sneak Attack). Additionally, the attack, as well as all other attacks made against the target until the start of your next turn, count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Opportunistic Piety By 7th level, you always keep a wide array of holy symbols and blessed items on your person, even if you aren’t particularly pious. When you use your Opportunistic Piety, you choose which effect to create from the list below. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Opportunistic Piety again. Banish. You cast the banishment spell without expending a spell slot. If the target is a Fey, Fiend, or Undead and fails its saving throw against this spell, it also takes radiant damage equal to your level. Miracle Healing. As an action, divine light from your hands knit the wounds of a willing creature you touch. That creature regains a number of hit points equal to twice your investigator level. This ability has no effect on Undead or Constructs. Warding. As an action, you trace a holy symbol on a creature within 5 feet of you, warding it against harm. For the next minute, Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead that touch the warded creature or hit it with a melee attack take 1d12 radiant damage. Supernatural Resolve At 9th level, you gain resilience to the attacks and effects of the creatures you regularly investigate. You can’t be possessed or charmed, and you have resistance to necrotic and psychic damage. Finisher Beginning at 11th level, you know exactly how to bring a monster down. Once on each of your turns when you take the Attack action and hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra 2d8 damage to the creature. If the creature has less than half its hit points remaining, you can instead deal an extra 4d8 damage to the creature. Enigma Arcane At 13th level, you uncover a magical secret connected to a wellspring of potent magic. You can cast one of the following spells once without expending a spell slot: mirage arcane, plane shift, reverse gravity, sequester, or teleport . Once you do so, you can’t cast any of these spells in this way again until you finish a long rest. At 15th level, you can also cast one of the following spells once without expending a spell slot: antimagic field, glibness, maze, or mind blank . Once you do so, you can’t cast any of these spells in this way again until you finish a long rest. At 17th level, you can also cast one of the following spells once without expending a spell slot: astral projection, gate, or weird . Once you do so, you can’t cast any of these spells in this way again until you finish a long rest. Exorcist Beginning at 18th level, you can cast the protection from evil and good spell without expending a spell slot or material components. Spellbinder By 20th level, many rituals you perform have become second nature to you. Select five ritual spells in your grimoire with a casting time of 1 action. You can cast these spells as a bonus action without expending a use of Rushed Incantation, and you can do so without your grimoire on hand. If the spell requires material components worth 100 gp or less, you can cast it without providing those components. Occult Specializations Investigators of all stripes share the broad goal of combating the occult, but their methods vary wildly. Some emphasize cutting down monsters and banishing demons, while others believe that uncovering secrets and compiling critical information is the surest method for eliminating supernatural threats. When an investigator gains enough experience, they can steer their approach, including the specific techniques they employ and the trinkets they carry, into an occult specialization, a school of thought for handling eldritch threats. Occult Specializations Name Descriptions Antiquarian Festooned with powerful magical trinkets of all shapes and sizes Archivist A scholar who collects scraps of ancient lore Detective Chases down clues and unravels crimes with their impressive intellect Exterminator Hunts down vampires, lycanthropes, and beasts that stalk the night Inquisitor An agent of the church that performs exorcisms and roots out heresy Medium Foretells events of the future using a magical connection to the dead Occultist A magician borrowing spells from wizards and warlocks Spy Infiltrates with perfect disguises and unmatched charm",

        "name": "Jaeger",
        "description": "An unassuming human pounces in the night, his blade and revolver at the ready. A gunshot, followed by the sound of metal against flesh and the splattering of blood over cobblestone. He snickers before plunging his blade anew into his battered prey. An elegant manikin vaults atop a maddened monster, before putting the barrel of her cannon against its skull and pulling the trigger. She always loved explosions. Battleaxe in hand, a massive tiefling brutally decapitates a beast, then leaps towards another, impaling the silvered weapon in the creature’s chest and ripping a gashing wound from neck to groin. Jaegers are defined by their efficiency in battle, using their mastery over both steel and gunpowder to lay waste to all who oppose them. More than just soldiers, their skills represent the last wall of defense of a world fated to extinction; they are unstoppable and unbreakable. They strike fear in the heart of their foes, and bring hope to those they protect. Engineered Perfection In the ease and safety that contemporary advancements bring, city dwellers frequently forget how fortunate their lives are. They have all but forgotten the life of pain that would befall them if the system failed. Which is precisely what took place in Luyarnha. The urbanites were left defenseless when the scourge swept the streets of the city, snapping like twigs in the face of such ferocity. While the denizens of the town struggled against insurmountable odds, the church and the nobility didn’t remain inert, instead concentrating their efforts to engineer the ideal weapon, something capable of annihilating the beasts plaguing the city. This weapon came to be known as the jaegers. Jaegers thrive in the savagery of the hunt. Their reflexes more honed than that of mere mortals, jaegers are capable of dodging the most vicious of blows and using that momentum to drive their blade deep into the heart of their prey. A jaeger’s thirst for battle is endless; only in inaction can they experience fatigue. They are the perfect weapon against the nightmarish tides of beasts and the sole reason Luyarnha still stands. Bonds of Blood One who hunts beasts is a “hunter”, as they are commonly called by civilized society, but few hunters have the jaeger class. Coming from all walks of life, jaegers blend in with their communities, only unleashing their abilities in times of need. They act as guardians for people who are unable to defend themselves, and they serve as the bloody sword of vengeance in a world that is hell-bent on destroying itself. Life in the city-state of Luyarnha is fraught with peril: gang warfare, infectious madness, and harrowing beasts. Amidst this chaos, jaegers are the first to charge into battle so that their brothers and sisters can survive to live another day. Jaegers rarely leave their home city of Luyarnha; they would rather die than see it fall to the scourge. Following the jaeger's creed—'survive together, or die together'—they never hunt by themselves unless forced to. The nights can be brutal and the beasts are relentless; against such a ferocious onslaught, only a united front can hope to survive. As a result, jaegers are aware of the importance of teamwork and never charge into battle alone, save to retrieve fallen allies. The bonds formed during the hunts are stronger than those of many families. Blood is thicker than water, and the gods know that blood is shed when the hunt rages on. “There is nowhere left to hide. We know you now. We shall hunt you in every plane of existence. We shall cleanse these walls, then we shall cleanse the world. So look upon me now, beast, and know your slayer.” —Steinhardt, The First Hunter. Creating a Jaeger Think about the nature of your abilities and what gave rise to them as you construct your jaeger character. Were you one of the numerous orphans whose bodies were experimented on in the jaeger research project? Did you voluntarily join the ranks of hunters, or were you abducted and brainwashed into the ideal soldier? Alternatively, you might have defied the established order and joined the jaegers by a different route, perhaps after finding an eldritch carving and engraving it on your flesh. You might be self-taught—a loner who learned combat skills, tracking, or even a magical connection to the cosmos through the necessity of surviving the hunts. Alternatively, you might have learned from the comrades you now consider family. What fuels you? Is it a visceral hatred of the beasts that slaughtered your loved ones? Or is it a reflection of your desire to stop these monsters' devastation, committing yourself to reining in their carnage? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in annihilating the scourge of beasts, or a significant change? What made you join a band of adventurers? Do you enjoy the break from the hunt that new allies provide, or do you find it difficult to teach them the jaeger ways? Quick Build You can make a jaeger quickly by following these guidelines. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, and then Intelligence. Second, pick a background, preferably one that involves the city of Luyarnha.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per jaeger level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per jaeger level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: Two martial weapons (a) a pistol and pouch of 20 bullets or (b) any two simple weapons (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack Flexible Combatant Beginning at 1st level, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one, and you can reload weapons with the loading, reload, or barrel properties without a free hand. Additionally, if you are carrying a one-handed melee weapon in one hand, and a one-handed ranged weapon in the other, you do not have disadvantage from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature on attacks made with that ranged weapon. Focus Starting at 1st level, your concentration during battle is razor sharp, letting you keenly focus during critical moments. You have 1 Focus Point. You gain additional Focus Points at 2nd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, as shown on the Jaeger table. You can expend Focus Points to use Focus Arts. You learn two such Focus Arts: Weapon Parry and Dodge Step. You learn one additional Focus Art of your choice at 2nd, 7th, 13th, and 17th level. Your Focus Art options are detailed at the end of the class description. You regain all expended Focus Points when you finish a short or long rest. When you roll a 20 on a saving throw or an attack roll against a hostile creature, you regain 1 Focus Point. When you roll initiative and have no Focus Points remaining, you regain 1 Focus Point. Weapon Parry Focus Art, reaction As a reaction to being hit by a creature you can see within range of a weapon you are holding, you can expend 1 Focus Point to make a special weapon attack against that creature. This attack does no damage, but instead blocks an amount of damage from the incoming attack equal to the weapon's damage roll (including your ability modifier), unless your attack roll is a 1. On a 20, any weapon damage dice are rolled twice (like a critical hit would be), and if this total fully blocks the incoming attack, the target is stunned until the start of its next turn. Dodge Step Focus Art, reaction As a reaction to being attacked by a creature you can see, if your speed is not 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks and make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the attacker's attack roll (including modifiers). On a success, you evade completely and take no damage. On a failure, you halve the attack's damage against you. Eldritch Hunter Also at 1st level, when you make an ability check to track or identify an aberration, celestial, fiend, monstrosity, or undead, you can add your proficiency bonus to the ability check. If you are already proficient in the ability check, you can double your proficiency bonus. Momentum Starting at 2nd level, any time you expend a Focus Point, you gain 1 Momentum die, which is a d6. This die changes as you gain jaeger levels, as shown in the Jaeger table. You can have a maximum number of Momentum dice equal to your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is higher). Whenever you gain a Momentum die, or if you attack or end your turn within 5 feet of a hostile creature, all of your Momentum dice last until the end of your next turn. While you have 1 or more Momentum dice, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to execute a Finisher. You know the Brutal Finisher. You learn one additional Finisher (listed at the end of the class description) of your choice at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 12th level, and may gain others through Jaeger Chapter features. Note: Momentum functions like a barbarian’s rage —as long as you meet one of the criteria, you keep all your Momentum dice until the end of your next turn. Did you gain a Momentum die? If yes, keep your momentum dice. Did you attack a hostile creature? If yes, keep your Momentum dice. Did you end your turn within 5 feet of a hostile creature? If yes, keep your Momentum dice. Brutal Finisher Finisher, special When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend all of your Momentum dice and add them to the damage roll. If you reduce the target to 0 hit points with this Finisher, or the target is reduced to 0 hit points before the start of your next turn, you regain 1 Focus Point. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Flexible Fighting You can engage in two-weapon fighting with any weapons you can wield in one hand, including one-handed ranged weapons and weapons without the light property. When you do so, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage rolls of both weapons. Focused Fighting You learn an additional Focus Art, and you gain 1 additional Focus Point. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Jaeger Chapter When you reach 3rd level, you choose a jaeger chapter that suits the means by which you intend to further your powers. Select one of the following: Absolute Chapter , Heretic Chapter , Marauder Chapter , Salvation Chapter , or Sanguine Chapter . Piercing Gaze Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to activate a magical sight at will (no action required), allowing you to effortlessly pierce the gloom and see what lurks within. For 1 hour, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases to 120 feet. This vision lets you see normally in dim light and darkness, both magical and nonmagical. When you reach 7th level, you also gain the effect of see invisibility for the duration, and when you reach 13th level, you additionally gain the effect of true seeing for the duration. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Seasoned Survivor At 4th level, you gain advantage on Investigation checks made to find secret passages, interpret markings or messages left by other creatures on walls or surfaces, or determine the fate of creatures from blood stains and remains. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Hunter's Pursuit Starting at 6th level, at the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to immediately move up to half your speed without using any of your movement and without provoking opportunity attacks. Evasion Beginning at 9th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Lethal Tempo Starting at 11th level, the first time you hit a creature on your turn, you gain 1 Momentum die. You gain 1 additional Momentum die any time you reduce a creature to 0 hit points. Relentless Pursuit Starting at 13th level, when you use your Hunter's Pursuit, if you end your movement next to a hostile creature, you regain the expended Focus Point. Inured to Madness At 15th level, you gain advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and against effects that cause madness. If you fail a saving throw against madness, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll the die. You must use the new roll. Eternal Watch Starting at 18th level, you are always under the effect of your Piercing Gaze. Always Ready Starting at 20th level, once per round (beginning at the start of each of your turns), you gain one additional reaction, which you can only use on a Focus Art that requires a reaction (such as Weapon Parry or Dodge Step). When you expend a Focus Point on this special reaction, you immediately regain the expended Focus Point. Chapters \"Your foe is well equipped, well trained, battle-hardened. He believes his blasphemous god is on his side. Let him believe what he will. We have the jaegers on ours.\" —Vicar Priscilla Absolute Chapter Heretic Chapter Marauder Chapter Salvation Chapter Sanguine Chapter Additional Focus Arts Aerial Vault Focus Art, special When you make a jump, you can expend 1 Focus Point to double your jumping distance for that jump, and you can ignore difficult terrain until the end of your turn. When you use this Focus Art, the maximum distance you can jump isn’t limited by your walking speed. Elemental Art Focus Art, bonus action As a bonus action, you expend 1 Focus Point and touch a weapon you're carrying. Choose between acid, cold, fire, or lightning. For 1 minute, the weapon deals that damage type instead of its normal type. Focus Mind Focus Art, reaction As a reaction to making a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, or having your mind read or influenced, you can expend 1 Focus Point to gain advantage on the roll. If you already have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once. Flourish Focus Art, bonus action As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Focus Point and gain 1 additional Momentum die (gaining 2 Momentum dice in total, which includes the die gained through the Momentum feature from expending the Focus Point on Flourish). I Don't Want To Be Eaten Today Focus Art, reaction As a reaction to becoming grappled or restrained by an effect that has an escape DC or to making a contested roll against these conditions, you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt to immediately escape the effect, making an Athletics or Acrobatics check against the escape DC, or to gain advantage on the contested roll. Jaeger's Rush Focus Art, bonus action As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take the Dash action. Jaeger's Assessment Focus Art, bonus action As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to make an Investigation check against a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, contested by its Deception check. On success, you learn its creature type, AC, any resistances or immunities it has to damage or conditions, and any spells it is under the effect of. Alternatively, when you take this bonus action, you can take the Search action. Finishers Breaking Blow Finisher, special When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to force the target to make a saving throw, suffering a condition for 1 minute on a failure. The DC of the save is 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus. The type of saving throw and the condition depend on the number of Momentum dice you have when you use this Finisher. You can choose to inflict a condition that requires fewer Momentum dice than you expend, but all Momentum dice are expended regardless of the condition selected. The target can repeat its saving throw against the condition at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If the condition inflicted is Prone, they do not need to pass a subsequent save and can end the condition by standing as normal instead. If the target fails its initial save against the effect, you regain 1 Focus Point. Momentum Dice Saving Throw Condition 1 Strength Prone 2 Constitution Blinded 3 Strength Restrained 4 Constitution Stunned 5+ Constitution Paralyzed Chasing Finisher Finisher, bonus action As a bonus action, you expend all of your Momentum dice to move 10 feet per die expended before making a melee weapon attack. On a hit, add the expended Momentum dice to the attack’s damage roll. If you move at least 30 feet using the Finisher, you regain 1 Focus Point. Hemorrhaging Wound Finisher, special When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to rend a vicious bleeding wound. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it loses hit points equal to the Momentum dice expended. Each time it takes damage from this effect, the number of dice of damage it takes at the end of its next turn is reduced by 1, and the bleeding stops when the number of dice would be reduced to 0. A bleeding creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, after taking the damage, ending the effect on a success. The DC of the save is 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus + half the number of dice remaining, rounded down. Applying a new bleed while the target is still bleeding does not stack, but instead refreshes the number of dice of damage taken from the bleed to the higher of the two values. Opportunistic Shot Finisher, reaction As a reaction when a creature within 20 feet of you becomes paralyzed, restrained, or stunned, you can expend all of your Momentum dice and make a single weapon attack with a firearm you are holding. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the weapon's damage roll plus the expended Momentum dice, it is knocked prone, and you regain 1 Focus Point. Vicious Finisher Finisher, bonus action As a bonus action, you expend all of your Momentum dice to form a spectral beast claw around one hand and make a melee weapon attack with it against a creature within 5 feet of you. You can use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls of this attack. On a hit, the target takes magical slashing damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier + the Momentum dice expended. This attack has a higher critical hit range based on the number of Momentum dice expended, reducing the roll needed by 2 for each die, up to a maximum of scoring a critical hit on a 10-20 with 5 Momentum dice. If the Finisher is a critical hit, you regain 1 Focus Point. Volley Finisher Finisher, bonus action As a bonus action while you are holding a firearm, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to reload and fire a spray of shots at blinding speed. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failure, a creature takes piercing damage equal to the Momentum dice expended. If the Finisher damages 2 or more creatures, you regain 1 Focus Point. Clarification: Momentum Dice Whenever you add the number of Momentum dice expended to damage, roll the expended dice and add the total rolled to the damage, not the number of dice itself.",

You have set your quest to rid this evil by any means necessary. The means justify the end, and violence is but a mere tool of punishment handed out to the guilty. You are both the judge and executioner of those who have taken to the dark arts. Your eyes have witnessed hundreds of suspected magic users burned at a stake and tortured by pitiless investigators. The truth shall reveal itself through pain and blood, but how many of those you convicted were genuinely innocent or completely guilty? Obscured by the puritanical education and oath you have sworn to, you now begin to see the world's truth. For all the evil you have destroyed, it has not changed the course of humankind. Every human has both good and evil within them. It is time to change your course and discover the true nature of evil and if you have sentenced those who have partaken in it. Level P.

As part of the Attack action against a creature, make an Investigation skill check with a DC equal to 5 + the creature’s CR (rounded up). You have advantage on this check if you are targeting an Enemy of the Inquisition. Certitude: If you succeed, you recognize the creature’s crimes. You are armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of the Inquisitorial Records and you recall how to exploit their vices and weaknesses. For the next minute, you gain the benefits of the spell Hunter’s Mark against this creature; you don’t need to maintain concentration on it and you can’t move it to another creature if this one dies. Doubt: If you fail, your doubts make you falter - maybe you are unsure about the creature’s nature, or you fail to recall the prescribed methods to dispatch them. Your attacks against that creature have disadvantage until the start of your next turn. Practice makes perfect: Select the place where you forged your path as an apprentice: Attorney of the Inquisition Courts When the Inquisitorial Courts demand justice, the Judge wields it using their favorite weapon, The Gavel. There is magic within households, behind churches, and in dark alleys. The Judge must locate this black magic and destroy its user. Gavel: As bonus action you can use your Gavel to smite an enemy that can see it within 15 ft of you. The target must succeed on a DEX SAVE or take 1d6 Radiant damage and be blinded until the end of your next turn. Examiner: You gain proficiency in Intimidation. If you already have proficiency with that skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Intimidation check you make. This feature does not stack with other bonuses that double your proficiency bonus for this skill. Inquisition Inspector Behind the lavish trials and public sermons lies the true work of a Judge of the Inquisition Courts. The art of interrogating suspected heretics is a skill that not many have. Distinguishing falsehoods is one challenge, but to extract the truth is entirely different. Facing the Book: As bonus action you present your Book of Sins to sear the flesh of an enemy that can see it within 15 ft of you. The target must succeed on a DEX SAVE or lose its resistance and/or immunity to fire damage until the end of your next turn. The creature then takes 1d6 Fire Damage. Investigator: You gain proficiency in Insight. If you already have proficiency with that skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Insight check you make. This feature does not stack with other bonuses that double your proficiency bonus for this skill. Level 2 Spellcasting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the tools of your enemies to hunt them down. Spell Slots The Judge of Absolution table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Judge of Absolution spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Alarm and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Alarm using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Judge of Absolution spell list. The Spells Known column of the Judge of Absolution table shows when you learn more Judge of Absolution spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Judge of Absolution spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Judge of Absolution spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Judge of Absolution spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Judge of Absolution spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellcasting Focus and Somatic Components At 2nd level, you can use one of your Weapon of Purifications as a focus to cast spells that require a Material component. You can cast spells that require a Somatic component from the Judge of Absolution spell lists even if you have both hands occupied, as long as both hands are holding a Weapon of Purification. Urban combatant: when you are wearing light armor or no armor and are wielding a Weapon of Purification in each hand, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your AC. No matter what armor you wear, as long as you are wielding a Weapon of Purification in each hand, you gain the following bonus: when you take the Attack action and make an attack with a Light weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding. Being within 5 ft. of an hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attacks with hand crossbows. Level 3 Rituals of Purification: you have learned the secrets required to create a Weapon of Purification. You hold the weapon in your hand(s) and perform a ritual that lasts 1 hour (that can be completed during a Short Rest); after that, the weapon gains all the benefits of a Weapon of Purification on top of its original ones. You can never have more than 2 Weapons of Purifications at the same time. Divine Protection: The Gods help those who help themselves. You learn the Shield spell; this spell doesn’t count against the total spells you can know. Book of Sins, Addenda I: You enhance your Inquisition manual with more tools.

This spell doesn’t count against the total of spells you can know.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Deep knowledge: you know 1 additional spell from the Judge of Absolution List. Tools of the Inquisition: Enemies of the Inquisition have disadvantage on the saves to avoid the effects of your Gavel or Facing the Book features.

The creature must succeed on a WIS SAVE or become visibly branded with a Mark of Purification until the start of your next turn.

The effects of the Judgment are applied to every enemy targeted. Level 12 When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

        "description": "Born in Light In a world of chaos, you cast a bright light over the dark path of evil. To be darkness, Light must exist. You learned the art of combat at an early age. You were raised in a convent of the Sisters of Everlasting Light and became proficient in combat and fabricating the Magic of Light from a young age. The Sisters of the monastery would claim you were molded from the Light, forged for the good of this world and raised by the holy word. You are an experiment of good, unleashed on the earth to rid it of its sins. Your only quest is to vanquish evil from this world. To bring it to its knees and plead for atonement. You do not seek violence or conflict but will act swiftly within it. Violence begets violence, and you use your powers to avert it whenever possible. You have only known good in your life; evil is the opposite of everything you breathe. You have no knowledge about romantic love or friendship and were raised to fight and rid the sins of the world; it is the curse that you have been handed. You have been raised in this glass shell, yet you must break it to discover who you are and what you can become. To do so, you must discover your past. Who left you at the convent, who took away your will and choice to be decided by others, albeit holy people? You must learn from the Sisters where you were raised and your origins. If you have any family, are they alive? Although you cannot change your past, you can forge your future.

Troubled times forced you to shelter your powers for most of your life, yet now you understand that you cannot fight them, and you must fully embrace that ethereal link that binds your soul. Unearthing your true potential and the latent powers within you will entail a long journey of discovery. In your quest, you will also face those who oppose using magic and persecute it because they fear it and fail to understand its origin. In your travels, you will encounter witches and other sorcerers who are persecuted, tried, and put to the flames for their actions. It is time for you to play your role in what you can do to make those understand that magic is like a word; it can speak the truth and do good, yet it can also deceive and cause destruction. Level P.

You learn additional Magi cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Magi table. Spell Slots he Magi table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Magi spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell's level or higher slot, and you regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Magi spell list. The Spells Known column of the Magi table shows when you learn more Magi spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose up to two of the Magi spells you know and replace them with other spells from the Magi spell list; they also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Your spellcasting ability as a Maga / Magus is Your spellcasting ability as a Magi is Wisdom, reflecting your connection to your innate intuition and the mystical forces around you. Whenever a spell mentions your spellcasting ability, rely on your Wisdom. Furthermore, when determining the saving throw DC for your Delver of the Abyss spells or making an attack roll with them, apply your Charisma modifier. Here's how to calculate these values: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Level 1 Spirit Malady: Your knowledge of the mystical arts allows you to addle the mind or consume the body of those who seek to oppose you.

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range; on a hit, the target takes 2d6 Poison Damage and they can’t take reactions until the start of their next turn. You can use your Staff of the Elements feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you recover any expended usage when you complete a long rest.

Level 6 Empowered Staff: You recover any expended Staff of the Element usage when you complete a short rest. Each power granted by that feature is improved: · Heal: When you use the Heal power, you add your Wisdom modifier to the amount healed. · Protect: The Protect effect bonus to AC becomes equal to your proficiency bonus. · Fulmen: You can target up to two creatures with this attack. Level 7 Augury: as long as you are not surprised, you can use your reaction when rolling initiative to change the initiative value of another creature that you can see within 60 ft. of you.

        "name": "Martyr",
        "description": "Squalid masses draw close around a young dwarf in spotless clothing. He touches each person in turn, healing injuries, curing illnesses, and restoring hope. A ragged tiefling speaks in a crowded square. As if in response, dark clouds gather over her head and the earth trembles at her words. A mad king spits and swears from his throne at imperial guards who have fled or been slain. A lone dragonborn stands before him, solemnly preparing herself for divinely demanded regicide. Martyrs are implements of the gods, hand-picked to spill their blood in service of a divine cause. Such an end is inevitable, for once a martyr is chosen, their fate is fixed in the heavens. Fated to Die Martyrs are chosen by the gods as prophets, oracles, great priests, and liberators. However, regardless of how much good they might accomplish in their lives, the end must always be the same: a glorious death, to be remembered in legend. No matter the circumstance, a martyr cannot avoid their destiny. While some martyrs gladly accept their holy approbation, others struggle against it. However, from the moment the gods choose their martyr, they shall intervene in the martyr’s fate, pulling them inexorably toward their cause. The gods will settle for a lesser martyr if they must—if the one chosen dies too soon—but they always prefer to uplift their martyr to the heights of sainthood before their inevitable demise. Blood of the Martyr Martyrs grow more powerful the closer they are to death, and those that spill their own blood evoke waves of divine energy. In the view of the gods, such hardship is necessary to lay the foundation for a story that will live on in history. Paradoxically, martyrs are protected from death’s precipice even as they are edged closer toward it. Every torment and persecution suffered by them is weighed with equal moments of respite offered by the gods. The gods do not mean to kill their charge early; a martyr should meet their fate only at the preordained time and place. Creating a Martyr As you create a martyr, think about the moment you were chosen by the gods and your burden was placed upon you. Were you visited by an angelic host or a god disguised as a mortal? Did you quietly hear a divine voice in your ear, as stigmata formed on your body? Was your soul violently dragged to the Upper (or Lower) Planes for an audience with the gods? Consider the life you led before you were ordained for martyrdom. Were you a wicked soul, purified and redeemed to undergo this task? Were you already a warrior, adventurer, or cleric in service of the gods? Also consider how you reacted. Did you accept the task and your inevitable destiny, or did you run from it? Are you still running? Quick Build To build a martyr quickly, follow these suggestions: Constitution should be your highest ability score. Your next highest ability score should be Strength if you choose a Burden, such as the Burden of Revolution, which focuses on melee combat, or Wisdom if you choose one focused on spellcasting. Choose any background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d12 per martyr level Hit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per martyr level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple and martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Strength, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons (a) scale mail or (b) chain mail (if proficient) (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack A holy symbol Mortal Burden Beginning at 1st level, you are fated to perish in the name of a great ideal, cementing your name alongside others who have done the same. Choose a Mortal Burden, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. Burden Spells Each burden has a list of associated spells that you gain at the martyr levels specified in the burden description. Once you gain access to a burden spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a burden spell that doesn’t appear on the martyr spell list, the spell is nonetheless a martyr spell for you. Ordained Death As a martyr, you have been predestined by the gods to perish for a great cause; there is no greater glory in death, and no greater joy in the afterlife. However, it is not yet your time. Starting at 1st level, when you fall to 0 hit points and begin to make death saving throws, you must fail 5 saving throws to die. Additionally, if a spell has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need material components to cast the spell on you. Mark of the Herald At 2nd level, your divine cause manifests itself upon you, forming a special mark or stigmata for all to see. You have advantage on ability checks you make to convince other creatures to assist you in service of your holy cause. Spellcasting Starting at 2nd level, you can leverage the power of your suffering to cast divine magic. Casting Spells To cast one of your martyr spells of 1st level or higher, you must lose hit points to create and expend a spell slot greater than or equal to that spell’s level. The number of hit points is listed on the Hit Points Spellcasting table and can’t be reduced or avoided. You don’t make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells as a result of losing these hit points. The Martyr table shows the maximum level of spell slot you can create. The Spell Uses column of the Martyr table shows how many spells you can cast. When you expend hit points to cast a spell, you expend one of these uses. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Hit Points Spellcasting Spell Level Point Cost 1st 5 2nd 10 3rd 20 4th 30 5th 45 Preparing Spells You prepare the list of martyr spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the martyr spell list. When you do so, choose a number of martyr spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your martyr level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). Spells you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the Max Spell Level column for your level. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Healing Magic Because your power is derived from mortal suffering, you can’t regain hit points from any spell you cast. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your martyr spells, since your power originates in the devotion used to overcome your trials and tribulations. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a martyr spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your martyr spells. Sainted Reprisal Also at 2nd level, you can reprimand those who draw your blood. When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) to that creature. The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). Divine Healing Starting at 3rd level, you can utter a prayer to the gods for mercy. As an action, you can spend Hit Dice and regain hit points as if you had just finished a short rest. When you use this ability, you can spend a number of Hit Dice up to your proficiency bonus. Torment By 3rd level, you have learned to curry the gods’ favor through anguish and mortal trials. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can lose 5 hit points to deal an extra 10 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) to the target. You don’t make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells as a result of losing these hit points. Starting at 11th level, you can choose to lose 10 hit points to deal an extra 20 damage to the target. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Respite Beginning at 7th level, you regain all expended Hit Dice when you finish a long rest, instead of only half of them. Undying Conviction Beginning at 10th level, when you drop to 0 hit points but aren’t killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. March Unto Destiny At 15th level, your inevitable end draws nearer, and nothing can hold you from it. You don’t need to eat or drink, and can’t be paralyzed, petrified, or stunned. Final Martyrdom At 20th level, you have at last reached your predestination: you will die in eternal glory. You can use your action to become immune to all damage for 10 minutes. For this duration, you can’t be blinded, charmed, deafened, exhausted, frightened, incapacitated, poisoned, restrained, or rendered unconscious. You have advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Additionally, during this duration, you can cast the wish spell once, without expending a spell slot or hit points. If you use the spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell, the stress of casting it doesn’t reduce your Strength or cause you to take necrotic damage. At the end of this duration, you die. No force short of divine intervention can prevent your death, and you can’t be returned to life by any means. Mortal Burdens Martyrs are created and driven forth to right an inexorable wrong in the world. On this quest, they are a direct instrument of the gods, and no matter how hard they try, they cannot escape the burden of their duty. Mortal Burdens Name Description Burden of Atonement Aims to correct all the evils of their life through divine martyrdom Burden of Discord Spreads havoc and upsets the status quo Burden of the End One mission: prevent the end of the world Burden of Mercy Heals the sick and eases the suffering of all Burden of Rebirth Tasked with preserving the balance between civilization and the natural world Burden of Revolution Sent by the gods to spread freedom and crush despots Burden of Truth A prophet tasked with bringing a revolutionary truth to the world Burden of Tyranny Fated to become a king and rule with an iron fist",

        "description": "His palm extended, a dendus calls of a shimmer of frost to coalesce before him before unleashing its deadly cold toward his enemy. An lunar eldori weaves a micro-singularity—a black hole— which hovers over a nearby platform lifting and twisting all within its pull with a powerful crushing force. A utopian human touches an electrical port, extending her perceptions through the ship’s computer panels to gain an overview of the bridge nearby. Masters of matter and energy manipulation, melders have attuned themselves to the incredible raw power within the mysterious Crucibles. Using the energy within themselves, they are able to alter reality itself by combining, shaping and channeling the energies around them. It is an ability even the most learned of races still do not fully understand. Some espers wield their powers through use of sorium devices or implants. Melders know no such limitations. Their entire essence is infused with the power generated by the Crucibles, allowing them to draw matter and energy from around them and shape it to their desired form before releasing it. Weavers of the Cosmos Melders commune directly with the Crucibles in a system of codes and formula translated into controlled forms of energy. It is almost a language on its own, requiring a strong psyche to focus upon and comprehend as they “speak” with the forces around them. Once such a code is mastered it becomes part of the Melders repertoire of Talents. The most powerful of Melders view the forces of creation as one great cycle of energy, waiting to be tapped into. Channeling such massive surges of energy takes a toll on both the body and mind. It is almost as if they have two personas within them at the same time, each with a completely different train of thought. Once a Melder reaches their limit, they must recover their strength. If pushed further, they run the risk of both physical debilitation and possible descent into madness. Disciples of Infinity Due to their unique view of the connection between all things, a great many melders tend to try to look past the veil, striving to learn more about the nature of both their universe and the multiverse that exists beyond. Some believe that the Crucibles are merely a manifestation of realities and concepts that cannot yet be fathomed by the mortal mind, and that espers may be the key to their discovery. Creating a Melder When choosing Melder as your class, consider the event that took place in which your character was awakened to his or her abilities. Did something provoke this awakening? Perhaps they studied the practices of another melder? Maybe they were capable of strange feats at a young age, or encountered a strange creature or location where their powers manifested. Ability Scores Intelligence should be your primary ability score. Constitution could be considered secondary to supplement your hit points, followed by Wisdom and Charisma.

These represent the different methods you’ve learned in which you can shape matter and energy. Talent Points The Melder table shows the number of talent points you have to use on your esper talents. These points represent the amount of personal energy that must be channeled into the talent in order to produce the desired effect. Once your pool of talent points is depleted, you are on the brink of exhaustion. Your regain all of your points once you finish a long rest. Each talent has a rank and a point cost associated with it. If you do not have enough points to cover the cost, you can’t use the talent. You can only learn and use talents up to a certain rank depending on your level. These are shown in the Maximum Talent Rank column of the Melder table. Esper Ability Intelligence is your channeling ability for your melder talents, since you learn your talents through study, practice, and precise execution. You use your Intelligence whenever a talent refers to your chanelling ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a melder talent you use and when making an attack roll with one. Channeling save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Channeling attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Gaining Additional Talents You gain additional talents and ranks as you gain levels. Each time you gain a level as a melder, you learn two additional talents of your choice. They can be of any rank so long as they are not higher than the maximum talent rank you can use. Conventional Channeling You can use a talent conventionally if the talent has the conventional tag and it is in your list of known talents. Esper Recovery At 1st level, you are able to regain some of your spent energy through focus and meditative techniques. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover a small number of talent points. The number of points you can recover is equal to 2 plus half of your melder level (rounded down). Melder Discipline When you reach 2nd level, you choose a discipline, refining your powers into specialized abilities and practices. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Esper Mastery At 11th level, your attunement to the fundamental forces around you grants you the ability to channel advanced esper talents. Choose a rank 6 talent from the melder powers list. You can activate this power once by spending the required amount of talent points. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more adept talents of your choice that you can use in this way: One rank 7 at 13th level, one rank 8 at 15th level and one rank 9 at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Esper Mastery when you finish a long rest. Additionally, whenever you gain a new level in this class, you can replace one of your mastery talents with another talent fof the same rank from the melder powers list. Prime Channeling At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain talents that you can use them at will as prime talents. Choose a rank 1 melder talent and a rank 2 melder talent that are in your list of known talents. You can activate those talents at their lowest rank without spending any talent points. If you want to use either talent at a higher rank, you must spend the required talent points as normal. By spending 8 hours in meditation, you can exchange one or both of the talents you chose for different talents of the same ranks. This meditation can be performed during a long rest. Signature Talents When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful talents and can activate them with minimal effort. Choose two rank 3 melder talents in your list of known talents to become your signature talents. You can activate each of them once at rank 3 without expending any talent points. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to use either talent at a higher rank, you must spend the required talent points as normal. Melder Disciplines Melders are classified into subgroups known as disciplines. Whenever a potential melder reaches Esper Genesis, they are often directed to train under a specialist to determine their chosen discipline. Celestian Defender Metakinetic Protoweaver Psychogenic",

        "description": "Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows⁠, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending⁠ them reeling, until at last she stands alone. Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes. Moving with the silence⁠ of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow⁠ beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow⁠ on a balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep. Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat⁠ prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does. The Magic of Ki Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special⁠ attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes. Training and Asceticism Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families. Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command⁠ of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power. The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile⁠ warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants. For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure. Creating a Monk As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself? Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home? As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment. Quick Build You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background.

Perfect Self Class Features As a monk, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per monk level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons, shortswords Tools: Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a shortsword or ( b ) any simple weapon ( a ) a dungeoneer’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack 10 darts Unarmored Defense Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Martial Arts At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons⁠ that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. Ki Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. Unarmored Movement⁠ Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. Monastic Tradition When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Deflect Missiles Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the att⁠ack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged att⁠ack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this atta⁠ck with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the att⁠ack. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Slow Fall Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Stunning Strike Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. Ki-Empowered Strikes Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Evasion At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Stillness of Mind Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. Purity of Body At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison. Tongue of the Sun and Moon Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say. Diamond Soul Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. Timeless Body At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. Empty Body Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you. Perfect Self At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. Monastic Orders The worlds of D&D contain a multitude of monasteries and monastic traditions. In lands with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the western lands of Faerûn, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate. Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host. In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery. The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles of their nation and their race—the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant to rule the world. Monastic Traditions Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common⁠ in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level. Way of the Open Hand Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm. Open Hand Technique Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn. Wholeness of Body At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Tranquility Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. Quivering Palm At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.",

        "description": "A Martial Artist of Supernatural Focus Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does. Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery. Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline. Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

Level 6: Empowered Strikes Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike , it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type. Level 7: Evasion When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition. Level 9: Acrobatic Movement While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield , you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

        "description": "A withered old woman reaches out and grasps a battle-hardened knight by the arm. The knight laughs at the crone’s gesture before collapsing in mere seconds, desiccated and dead. A scarred and grizzled warrior in breastplate leads a charge through a detachment of soldiers, swinging a glaive shrouded in dark energies at her foes. A shambling, undead vanguard follows her path, and her slain foes rise to join their ranks. A grim, robed figure presides before his court, all arranged in a marble hall of gothic construction. Shambling corpses, abominations of flesh and bone, and dead-eyed, charmed nobles wait in attendance, forming perfect lines in silent obedience. Necromancers are spellcasters that hold sway over the forces of life and death, twisting them to serve their own ambitions and commanding small armies of lifeless, animated thralls. Morbid Curiosity Necromancers must match their grand intellects with an equal lack of scruples—the willingness to turn to forbidden knowledge and unquestionably evil methods. No matter their means, every necromancer is driven by a deep fascination with the dark arts and the power necromancy can afford them. Most see themselves as outcast members of the academic elite, braving new territories of magic that other spellcasters are too cowardly to explore. However, collecting knowledge expanding their understanding is merely a means to an end for most necromancers; they are almost always driven by a deeper, darker impulse, a goal that pushes them to the utter brink. This might be the distorted ideal of a “greater good” or a goal to right the wrong of mortality. In every case, necromancy is a grim implement for their life’s work. Masters of Undeath Necromancers have learned through trial and error how to puppet the flesh, bone, and spirits of the dead, binding them to their will. Through their terrible magic, they command the forms of lesser undead, and demand respect from those powerful enough to resist their thrall. All necromancers share the capability of simply animating corpses, along with the knowledge and foresight to create new and terrible undead abominations to further their goals. Beyond the basic command over the undead, each necromancer specializes in a method to impart their will upon the world. Some dive deeply into the necromantic arts or focus on their ability to assert control over the weak, while others still master the art of both martial and magical combat. Though their skills might seem specialized, properly prepared necromancers can dominate both on the battlefield and at the round table. Creating a Necromancer As you create your necromancer, the most important piece of information to consider is your character’s ambition. What is your goal? How do you intend to achieve it? How does necromancy fit into the picture? Once you’ve decided on your ambition, consider why you turned to necromancy to accomplish it. Were you scorned by your previous spellcasting master? Did you come across an old, rotting tome filled with forgotten knowledge? Were you the survivor of some great attack by another necromancer? Work with your GM to determine how necromancy is viewed in the world. Is it just another method of spellcasting, or is it an abominable tool, used only by the most abhorred spellcasters? How do commoners react when they see you? Must you hide your thralls from public scrutiny, and if so, how? Furthermore, do the other player characters know of your sinister magic, and if so, how have they reacted to seeing your puppeteered corpses? Work with other players, especially those with cleric and paladin characters, to find suitable reasons you might work together. Quick Build You can make a necromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, and then Strength or Dexterity if you plan to choose the Death Knight ambition. Second, choose a background of your choice, preferably one that ties into your ambition. Third, choose chill touch, hocuspocus, light, and spark of life for your cantrips, and then choose Gahoul’s shrieking skull and mage armor as your 1st-level spells.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d6 per necromancer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per necromancer level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: A dagger and any simple weapon (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus A shovel and (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) a scholar’s pack Spellcasting Your connection to the realm of negative energy allows you to cast powerful necromantic spells. Cantrips At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the necromancer spell list. You learn additional necromancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table. Spell Slots The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells of the 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spells Known of 1st Level And Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the necromancer spell list. You learn an additional necromancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the necromancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, since your power is rooted in the fine manipulation of negative energy and research into magical secrets. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast any necromancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells. For a necromancer, these are typically objects with sentimental value, such as a locket, childhood toy, prison shackle, or wedding ring, which are altered with magically conductive materials. Charnel Touch Your connection to the negative energy realm grants you an inner nexus of dangerous power, ready to be unleashed at a moment’s notice. Starting at 1st level, you have a pool of Charnel Touch points equal to your necromancer level × 5 that replenishes when you finish a long rest. As an action, declare the number of points you wish to expend, up to a maximum of 5 × your proficiency bonus, and make a melee spell attack against one creature within your reach. On a hit, you expend the declared amount of points and deal necrotic damage equal to the points expended. If the attack misses, you don’t expend any points. The damage dealt by your Charnel Touch is doubled when you score a critical hit, expending no additional points. This attack deals no damage to Constructs and instead heals Undead for the number of points expended. You can target a willing creature with this ability without making a spell attack roll. Variant Rule: Necromancy Unleashed This class imposes limitations on animate dead -style spells, as well as the number and types of thralls a player can use in order to ensure timely, balanced play. If you’d like to throw caution to the wind and embrace the undead horde experience, use this variant rule. Ignore the “Animate Dead” section in the Thralls feature. Animated undead from spells are separate from your thralls for the purposes of your class features, but have no other class-based limitations. Thralls While lesser spellcasters can only animate flesh and bone in a rudimentary fashion, and must expend valuable energy to maintain their undead’s loyalty, true necromancers can provide their undead with a portion of their own life force, ensuring long-term obedience. Beginning at 2nd level, you learn an ancient and powerful ritual that allows you to raise and command your own army of the undead. Animate Thralls By spending 10 uninterrupted minutes performing this ritual with a spellcasting focus or component pouch, you can raise the remains of one or more Small or Medium Humanoids within 30 feet of you into Undead creatures. Undead created in this way become your thralls. You maintain control over your thralls indefinitely. Stat blocks for skeletons, zombies, and other thralls can be found in the Undead Thralls section at the end of the class description. Commanding Thralls You can mentally control all of your thralls while you are conscious without using any actions. If you are unconscious, your thralls will move to protect your body from harm, but will not attack. In combat, your thralls take their turns immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice). All your thralls collectively share one reaction and bonus action, which a single thrall can use each round. Thralls use your spell attack modifier to make their attacks. Maximum Thralls You can animate and control one thrall of challenge rating (CR) 1/4. As you gain levels in this class, you can animate more thralls. The combined CR of all your thralls can’t exceed the number shown in the Thrall CR Total column of the Necromancer table, and the total number of thralls under your control can never exceed your proficiency bonus. At any time, you can use your action to sever your connection to one or more thralls, releasing them. Corporeal Undead crumple into a heap and incorporeal Undead flee to the Ethereal Plane. Animate Dead Beginning at 5th level, a necromancer can learn the animate dead spell, a staple of the school of necromancy. Necromancers can cast this spell as an action, instead of over the course of 1 minute. All Undead created by the animate dead spell (as well as any other magic, such as the create undead spell, that allows you to control Undead) count as your thralls and can be commanded as such. If your new thralls granted to you by a spell cause you to exceed your total CR or number of thralls, you can immediately sever your connection to any of your existing thralls so as to stay within these limits. Your thralls can never command or create other Undead. As always, you can’t reanimate Undead that have been reduced to 0 hit points. Your Animate Thralls ritual, the animate dead spell, and similar magic only affects Humanoid corpses, whereas your thralls are Undead creatures. Variant Thralls With the GM’s permission, Undead raised using the Animate Thralls ritual can be of types other than Humanoids. Such thralls might use existing Undead statistics (such as various skeletons, zombies, or spirits) when appropriate, or might use thrall statistics with variant weapons, AC, or traits. Bag of Bones Also at 2nd level, you learn how to create a necromantic magic item, a bag of bones . The bag connects to a vast extradimensional space that can only hold Medium or smaller corpses, bones, and Undead creatures; it violently expels anything else placed within it. You can use an action to place a corpse or willing Undead creature into the bag, up to a maximum of ten corpses or Undead creatures, or use your action to dump the contents of the bag, which land in spaces within 5 feet of you. You can transform any container you can carry into a bag of bones by performing a special ritual over the course of 1 hour while you hold it. This container ceases to be magical if you perform this ritual again to create a new bag of bones . The container always connects to the same extradimensional space. If the bag is placed inside an extradimensional space, such as that created by a bag of holding , it is destroyed. Its contents remain in the same extradimensional space until you create a new bag. Grave Ambition When you reach 3rd level, you decide on a proper path of research into the dark arts in order to carve a path leading toward your ultimate goal. Choose a Grave Ambition, detailed at the end of the class. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 20th level. Black Arcana Also beginning at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to replenish your Charnel Touch pool. Your pool regains 1d8 expended points, plus 1d8 for each level of the spell slot expended, up to a maximum of your pool’s total. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Critical Spellcasting At 5th level, your potent necrotic powers punish your enemy at the first sign of weakness. When a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against one of your spells, it automatically fails the save, and you can roll all the spell’s damage dice a second time, adding the total to the spell’s damage against that creature. The additional damage only applies to the creature that rolled a 1. Additionally, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Starting at 14th level, a creature automatically fails its saving throw against your spells and takes additional damage when it rolls a 1 or a 2. Additionally, your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20. Enthralling Presence At 7th level, the negative energy that flows through you reinforces your thralls against those who would seek to destroy or control your servants. Your thralls and other Undead you control are immune to effects that turn Undead and can’t be forcefully controlled by another creature while you are conscious. Undying Servitude When you reach 18th level, your connection to your thralls can pull them back from the brink of destruction. When a thrall under your control is reduced to 0 hit points but not destroyed outright, you can use your reaction to restore it to half of its maximum hit points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Lichdom By 20th level, you have unlocked the pinnacle of necromantic prowess, through which you will conquer death itself: The Rite of Lichdom. When you reach this level, you have completed your phylactery and are ready to undergo the rite. To do so, you shut yourself away for 30 days in an isolated location of your choice, and emerge as an immortal lich, an undead of unsurpassed power. Once the rite is complete, you gain the following benefits as well as those dictated by your choice of Grave Ambition. Phylactery A phylactery is an object that houses a lich’s soul, safeguarding its immortality. If you drop to 0 hit points, your body crumbles to dust, but your soul escapes to the phylactery. After 1d4 + 1 days, a new body coalesces as near to your phylactery as possible and you return to life (or rather, unlife). When your body reforms, you gain the benefits of a long rest. The new body is identical to the one that was destroyed. Undead Resilience You have immunity to necrotic and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition. Undead Traits You are immune to the effects of exhaustion and you don’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still rest for 4 hours to gain the benefits of a long rest. Though your type is Humanoid, spells and effects that specifically affect Undead affect you as well. You are immune to any effect that turns Undead. Phylactery A lich’s phylactery is as much a memento as it is their anchor to immortality, and as such, no two are alike. Phylacteries are often constructed from objects with sentimental value, such as family heirlooms or prized possessions, but can be fashioned from swords, pieces of armor, or even entire castles. Furthermore, every phylactery has a weakness, a critical flaw by which it can be destroyed, allowing its lich to be slain permanently. These weaknesses, too, are unique to each phylactery. One phylactery might require a ritual to be performed around it for 24 hours, while another might call for the phylactery to be dipped in the lava of an active volcano. Discuss with your GM the form your phylactery takes and what weakness it possesses. The dead rise, the dead walk, the dead reckon, the dead talk. Grave Ambitions Becoming a necromancer is seldom an accident. Almost all who dive into the secrets of life and death do so with a purpose, a method to the madness. This ambition is what drives them into the tenebrous corners of forgotten libraries, long-abandoned tombs, and the graveyards of simple commoners. Ambition drives them further into the dark, where only the light of their end goal can lead them through the all-consuming shadows. A necromancer’s grave ambition represents the path to their ultimate goal, the lengths they’ll go to achieve it, and a source of justification for their actions, if only to themselves. Grave Ambitions Name Description Blood Ascendant Granted power from vampiric blood, without the myriad vampiric weaknesses Death Knight Clad in armor, a terrible warrior brandishing dark energies and martial weapons Overlord A sinister manipulator backed by powerful allies Pale Master Emphasizes the purest form of necromancy and brandishes devastating spells Pharaoh An echo of the ancient god-kings, a priest and necromancer in equal measure Plague Lord A necromantic disease carrier who commands vile, corpulent minions Reanimator A mad scientist that stitches together new and terrible undead minions Reaper A furtive shadow of death, who foretells and beckons demise",

        "description": "Clad in plate armor⁠ that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield⁠ and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement. A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly inv⁠isible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there. Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness⁠. Whatever their origi⁠n and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest⁠, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion⁠. The Cause of Righteousness A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness⁠, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god. Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat⁠, mastering a variety of weapons⁠ and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice. Beyond the Mundane Life Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring⁠ for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country. Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion. Creating a Paladin The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy kni⁠ght in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champ⁠ion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shado⁠w, a k⁠night whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Many deities are worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall. How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul. As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignm⁠ent colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alig⁠nment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained. Quick Build You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the noble background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d10 per paladin level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: All armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma Skills: Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a martial weapon and a shield or ( b ) two martial weapons ( a ) five javelins or ( b ) any simple melee weapon ( a ) a priest’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack Chain mail and a holy symbol⁠ Divine Sense The presence of strong evil registers on your se⁠nses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestia⁠l, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampi⁠re Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. Lay on Hands Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Spellcasting By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divin⁠e magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See the general rules of spellcasting and the paladin spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spell⁠s of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spel⁠l slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spel⁠ls equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spe⁠lls of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spe⁠lls. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin s⁠pells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcastin⁠g Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Char⁠isma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Chari⁠sma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbo⁠l as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. Divine Smite Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8. Divine Health By 3rd level, the divine mag⁠ic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. Sacred Oath When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. Oath Spells Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spell⁠s at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spell⁠s don’t count against the number of spell⁠s you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. Channel Divinity Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Aura of Protection Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Aura of Courage Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Improved Divine Smite By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. Cleansing Touch Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. Sacred Oaths Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. Breaking Your Oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master’s Guide .

Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart. Oath of Devotion The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. Tenets of Devotion Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. Honesty : Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. Courage : Never fear to act, though caution is wise. Compassion : Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. Honor : Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. Duty : Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you. Oath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. Table: Oath of Devotion Spells Level Spells 3rd Protection from Evil and Good , sanctuary 5th Lesser Restoration , zone of truth 9th Beacon of Hope , dispel magic 13th Freedom of Movement , guardian of faith 17th commune , flame strike Channel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Sacred Weapon : As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious , this effect ends. Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead , using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Aura of Devotion Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Purity of Spirit Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell. Holy Nimbus At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead . Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Breaking Your Oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.

Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion. Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side. Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest . With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level. As a Bonus Action , you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature , up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature ; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature . Level 1: Spellcasting You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells , which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class’s description. Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin , your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells . Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins . Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails . Level 2: Fighting Style You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see \" Feats \"). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below. Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list of Cleric spells ). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip . Level 2: Paladin’s Smite You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. Level 3: Channel Divinity You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest , and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11. If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature. Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action , you can open your awareness to detect Celestials , Fiends , and Undead . For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell. Level 3: Paladin Subclass You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion , Oath of Glory , Oath of the Ancients , and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower. Breaking Your Oath A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath. A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh. If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 5: Faithful Steed You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared. You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest . Level 6: Aura of Protection You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1). If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them. Level 9: Abjure Foes As a Magic action , you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature ) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action , or take a Bonus Action . Level 10: Aura of Courage You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection . If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there. Level 11: Radiant Strikes Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike , the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage. Level 14: Restoring Touch When you use Lay On Hands on a creature , you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature : Blinded , Charmed , Deafened , Frightened , Paralyzed , or Stunned . You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature . Level 18: Aura Expansion Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation . Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended. Paladin Spell List This section presents the Paladin spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, C means the spell requires Concentration , R means it’s a Ritual , and M means it requires a specific Material component.

This section presents the Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and Oath of Vengeance subclasses. Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts. Oath of Devotion Oath of Glory Oath of the Ancients Oath of Vengeance",

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level. As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool. You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature. Level 1: Spellcasting You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class’s description. Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells. Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails. Level 2: Fighting Style You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see \"Feats\"). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below. Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip. Level 2: Paladin’s Smite You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. Level 3: Channel Divinity You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11. If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature. Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell. Level 3: Paladin Subclass You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and Oath of Vengeance subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower. Breaking Your Oath A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath. A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh. If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 5: Faithful Steed You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared. You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. Level 6: Aura of Protection You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1). If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them. Level 9: Abjure Foes As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action. Level 10: Aura of Courage You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there. Level 11: Radiant Strikes Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage. Level 14: Restoring Touch When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature. Level 18: Aura Expansion Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Truesight is recommended. Paladin Spell List This section presents the Paladin spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, C means the spell requires Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a specific Material component.

This section presents the Oath of Devotion, Oath of Glory, Oath of the Ancients, and Oath of Vengeance subclasses. Each of these subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts. Oath of Devotion Oath of Glory Oath of the Ancients Oath of Vengeance",

        "description": "Bastiano Lenzi kept his step steady and his face carefully neutral as he walked across the lavish gardens of the Colonna family villa, avoiding the clusters of guests animatedly talking and jesting. He was playing it overly safe maybe, but he wasn’t about to run any risks while in the lion’s den. He was neither invited nor welcome here, having cast his lot in with the Orsini, for better or worse. How all this played into Florentine politics was complicated, and Bastiano would have to explain all that to his allies back home on his return. For now, he concentrated on making his way into the villa proper, and once there, into the private offices of Fabrizio Colonna. Without his rare powers which stemmed from a deep understanding of the world’s true workings, he would never have made it there undetained. By carefully arranging, in his mind’s eye, selected strands of the World’s Weave around himself, he made curious looks slide aside, and caused no alarm even in those who would have recognized his features had they but properly looked. When he found Fabrizio’s study, he went in and stood for a few minutes, waiting for an elderly servant to finish dusting the bookshelves and shuffle out of the room, heedless of the intruder. Closing the heavy office door, Bastiano took a deep breath and went to work. With barely more than a glance at the papers scattered across the giant desk, he committed to memory a number of the letters and dispatches in their entirety. Even years from now, he would be able to recite each sheet of paper word for word. The letter he sought to read and memorize in minute detail was not on display, and so he began his search by opening the topmost drawer. In these times of scientific and philosophical development, you belong to the elite of learned citizens, like the famous scholar Leon Battista Alberti, and you even transcend the powers of most of them. There is little that you don’t know about the world, its inhabitants and the spheres beyond – and unlike even most of your colleagues, you have gained such insight as to allow you to manipulate the very forces of the cosmos. You have completed the studium generale of the artes liberales at one of Europe’s universities and most likely have a higher degree in either law, medicine or theology. Or all of them. You have read all important philosophical texts, from the classical works of Aristoteles to the newly translated writings of Plato and are one of the humanists that shape the era. Please read everything about “ Education “ in chapter 3. Or even better, read the entire chapter carefully, because you are a true polymath. Your background: You very likely come from a noble or patrician background or have been supported by the Church because of your many talents. In this case, you will have at least taken the lesser vows. With such a background and education, most doors open easily and you will be an honored member of society. You probably know some of the important philosophers of the time, like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola or Marsilio Ficino. Your prospects are almost limitless, so choose whatever profession best fits your character: You could be the teacher in a noble family – and don’t think that this is a lowly job! The above mentioned Ficino for example was not only Lorenzo de’ Medici’s and his children’s maestro, but became one of his most trusted advisors and a very wealthy man. Other sages have ascended into the high ranks of the Church or were granted important functions in the mighty city-state. You might also work as a physician or defend the nobility in their many lawsuits and thus gain access to the highest circles. Not every philosopher will automatically be successful and consort with the high and mighty. A failed philosopher who has set up shop over a grocery store and dabbles in astrology, sells potions or removes warts to extract a few soldi from servants and shop owners might also provide an interesting background. Note on female philosophers: Depending on how historically faithful your campaign is set up, you might need a good explanation why a woman was accepted into one of the venerated universities. If you make it very “realistic”, then your education will most likely have been gained through private studies with maestros in your family’s home or in a convent. Your status would in this case not be comparable to a man’s in the same field. This will pose a limitation, but might also deliver a strong motivation to work towards a more enlightened society. Please discuss this question with your GM. Philosopher’s Powers The philosopher can learn to wield extraordinary powers through his unparalleled understanding of the workings of creation. He begins with a suite of somewhat more mundane features as well as the starting power Caustic Remark. As the character ascends in level, he will be able to choose advanced powers whose level requirements he meets. The powers are grouped into the following categories for convenience: Divination, Comprehension, Words of Wisdom, See the Flaws and Weave Mastery. Please note that some of the more advanced powers require the mastery of a lesser power within the same category. Consult the Philosopher Table below for powers and Weave Points gained, and the individual power descriptions for requirements.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per philosopher level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per philosopher level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: light armor Weapons: simple weapons Tools: none Saving Throws: Intelligence, Charisma Skills: You need to pick Artes Liberales and can choose two additional skills from Arcana, Courtly Manners, History, Investigation, Law, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion. Spell Save DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: a simple weapon a scholar’s pack padded armor and a dagger a magnifying glass, a lamp, several maps of the stars and constellations (a) a healer’s kit or (b) a book with important law texts or (c) a holy bible (depending on your mastery of Law, Medicine or Theology) Starting Powers Weave Points, Language Master, Linguistic Recall, Peer Connections, Caustic Remark Starting Powers Weave Points You can use Weave Points to manipulate the forces of Possibility and Permanence to power a variety of abilities. Refer to the Philosopher Table for the points gained at various levels. Weave Points are either spent immediately upon use of a power, or invested into a power that is either set to be triggered at some later point or is continuous until purposely ended. Invested points can not be regained until the power they are invested in has been used or ended. Once the prepared power has been used, the invested Weave Points cannot be regained during the next long rest as normal. Language Master You speak, read and write Italian, Latin, Ancient Greek and 3 more languages of your choice Linguistic Recall You can perfectly recall one specific piece of writing you have read and the exact wording of any non-trivial conversation, lecture or speech you have heard in the past if you spend 1 Weave Point and succeed at a DC 12 Intelligence (Artes Liberales) check. Peer Connections You know more or less every serious colleague, and whichever city you visit, you are bound to know someone, and have probably exchanged letters with them, or at least have common acquaintances. There is usually some level of solidarity between philosophers, even when they differ in matters of philosophy. Caustic Remark Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: instantaneous Cost: – You make a devastatingly snarky remark the way only you can. If the target can hear and understand you, it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and also suffer a –2 to its Armor Class until the end of your next turn. This feature‘s psychic damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4). Advanced Powers Divination You have learned the ancient techniques of reading the stellar movements and drawing conclusions from your observations. In small ways, you can predict the future. The following Divination powers are available for you to master: Secrets of the Stars Requirements: Level 1 Cost: – The stars have warned you of the shape of things to come, granting you vague, disjointed hints of situations you will likely find yourself in. While these readings make no apparent sense at the time, when you are finally faced with a situation that fits the premonition, you recognize it and you are better prepared to deal with it. This power works like the Wizard’s Divination power “Portent” (Divination School feature), but you must have been able to see the stars during the preparatory long rest. Knew it Requirements: Level 2 Cost: – You are immune to being surprised. Thorough Preparation Requirements: Level 2 Cost: 1 WP (invested) per item You have just the thing you need. A simple object that would come in handy just now is in your pack – you had a sense you might need it. You must declare at the end of a long rest (and in a place where you can possibly acquire a range of items and goods) that you invest your Weave Point for one as yet unspecified item. While the character undoubtedly knows what is in his possession, the player doesn’t at this point. He can decide at any point what the object is and produce it from his belongings. At this point, the object is defined and can be used and kept normally. The invested Weave Point can then be regained during the next long rest. The object in question must be of a value of no more than 5gp. The nature of the object is of course subject to GM veto if the GM deems it utterly unreasonable. No Such Thing as Random Requirements: Level 3 Casting Time: 1 action Cost: 2 WP This power allows you to reduce random chance in decisions involving uninformed choices, such as which door or path to pick at a crossroads when no other useful information is available or no clear advantage discernible. The GM will hint at the easier, shorter or safer choice, according to what the character wants to know. To determine his response, the GM will secretly roll 1d10 for each choice, adding the philosopher’s proficiency bonus to the best choice (in the GMs judgement) and then answering the player’s question according to the highest result (without divulging the actual result). If the GM deems the question unanswerable, i.e. there is no best choice, they will simply make unmodified rolls. In case of a tie, decide in the character’s favor. Always in the Right Place Requirements: Level 4, Knew it Cost: – You are hard to hit in combat or by accident, as you always seem to be in just the right place to stay out of harm’s way. You have an effective AC of 16 (unmodifiable) as long as you are conscious and mobile. Deja Vu Requirements: Level 7 Cost: 3 WP (invested) As Secrets of the Stars, but: You have seen the events unfolding right now written in the stars. For one combat round or one minute outside of combat, all opponents have disadvantage and all allies have advantage. The power remains prepared until used, and only one instance can be prepared at any one time. The Future is an Open Book Requirements: Level 9, Deja Vu Cost: 3 WP per instance (invested) Multiple instances of Deja Vu can be prepared. Comprehension Through your diligent studies and your thorough knowledge of the works of the ancients – especially your deep understanding of Plato’s writings – you understand all things human to a remarkable degree. The following Comprehension powers are available for you to master: How Hard Can it Be Requirements: Level 1 Casting Time: bonus action Range: self Duration: instantaneous Cost: 1 WP As the bard feature Jack of all Trades, but useable only with Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks. Reciprocal Speech Requirements: Level 2 Casting Time: reaction Range: special Duration: until next long rest Cost: 1 WP Understand any spoken language, and speak it until the next long rest after being spoken to in that language. Understanding Requirements: Level 4 Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30 feet Duration: 10 minutes Cost: 2 WP You can read any language. Codebreaker Requirements: Level 6 Casting Time: special Range: 30 feet Duration: 10 minutes Cost: 2 WP Decode in your mind’s eye any coded writing; if the language is unknown, you will need Understanding as well. To use this power, you concentrate for 1 round per page of writing. Words of Wisdom You have acquired the wisdom of the ages through careful study of those philosophical giants of the ancient world on whose shoulders you stand. Not only do you comprehend, you transcend, and are able to help others with tasks you need never have learned yourself. The following Words of Wisdom powers are available for you to master: Good Conversation Requirements: Level 1 Casting Time: special Range: special Duration: instantaneous Cost: 1 WP The ancient Greeks knew the benefit of talking for mental health. Their term for conversational therapy was Good Conversation. The philosopher can help others lose Dismay points with this power. It can be used on one target during a long rest (lose 1 Dismay) and requires some private time spent together in actual conversation (this does not impinge on general long rest recovery). To be successful, the philosopher has to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 10. The Weave Point spent can’t be recovered during the long rest it is spent in – it counts as being spent after that long rest. Timely Assistance Requirements: Level 3, How Hard Can It Be Casting Time: bonus action Range: 10 feet Duration: special Cost: 1 WP The sharp mind of the philosopher allows him to offer useful advice on just about any undertaking, and often it just takes a word or two. Use of this power grants advantage to an ability check made by another character. If used together with the Weave Mastery feature Overcome Boundaries, it additionally allows for the elimination of one requirement for the action undertaken, such as a lock pick attempt without thieves’ tools. Martial Assistance Requirements: Level 6, Timely Assistance Casting Time: bonus action Range: 10 feet Duration: special Cost: 2 WP As Timely Assistance, but for all attack rolls in the next turn of the target If used together with the Weave Mastery feature Overcome Boundaries this adds 5 feet to your reach with a melee weapon or an upgrade of the damage die to the next highest die type (i.e. d4 to d6, d6 to d8 etc.). If the die to be upgraded is already a d12, add the philosopher’s proficiency bonus to all damage dice instead. Arcane Assistance Requirements: Level 6, Timely Assistance Casting Time: bonus action Range: 10 feet Duration: special Cost: 2 WP As Timely Assistance, but it helps with spellcasting, granting advantage to any required rolls by the caster, such as concentration checks or spell attack rolls. If used together with the Weave Mastery feature Overcome Boundaries this allows a one-step range increase (self becomes touch, touch becomes 5 feet, 5 feet and greater ranges are doubled) or a die step increase in damage as with Martial Assistance. See the Flaws Ever since you were able to think and observe, and especially once you began to study at the feet of the great men of learning, you had that nagging feeling that something was just not right with the world, that with everything you knew, the world should be slightly different. Your eyes have now begun to open, and you can see the cracks in reality, the flaws in the weave of the world. The following See The Flaws powers are available for you to master: Unveil the Motive Requirements: Level 1 Range: self Cost: – This feature allows the Philosopher to see the smallest of cracks in a person’s facade, granting advantage to a Wisdom (Insight) check to detect lies, predict actions etc. Poison Tongue Requirements: Level 3 Casting Time: reaction Range: 60 feet Duration: instantaneous Cost: 2 WP You insert a seemingly random word, which you imbue with the resonance of the Weave, during a single opponent’s utterance, or when he tries some ability check or attack roll. The target suffers –1d6 to his roll unless he successfully makes a Wisdom saving throw. If casting a spell without an attack roll, the target has to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or fail to cast the spell. The World Askew Requirements: Level 4 Casting Time: 1 action Range: special Duration: special Cost: 2 WP You notice minute details about your surroundings (or about people) that hint at earlier occurrences. A supernaturally gifted investigator, you can look at a place and rapidly determine what happened if any marks of an activity have been left at all. Minute details on a person such as a stain on their clothing, a bad shave or shoddily tied shoelaces can lead you to accurately guess baffling details about them. Understanding the interactions between Possibility and Permanence, you can often envision the actions that made the marks and you can make eeriely accurate guesses as to who or what executed those actions. Sometimes it is as if an entire scene unfolds before your mind’s eye like a theatre play. You have advantage when you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check using The World Askew, and if you succeed the GM gives you not only the required information, but one further piece of information (which would probably be impossible to conclude by any regular investigator using the evidence at hand). On a critical success, an entire scene plays out in your head – although the identities of people involved in the goings-on are probably still not always obvious. The GM should adjust the DC according to circumstances, like how long ago the investigated actions happened, how small or large the observed area is, or any other factors relevant to the situation. At his discretion, the GM might want to prepare a number of levels of information to discover, depending on which DC has been beaten by the check; or he can ask for further checks (still at advantage) to discover more (though without further WP cost, and only as long as the checks are successful), effectively leading the philosopher through the chain of events. Stutters of Confusion Requirements: Level 6, Poison Tongue Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 feet Duration: special Cost: 1 WP per –1 on target’s rolls, up to philosopher’s proficiency bonus Embedded within a curiously halting speech, the philosopher’s poisoned words cause confusion in any one target who listens and fails its Wisdom saving throw. The philosopher has to speak only one or two sentences, just a few seconds really, and then let the words fester in the victim’s mind. At any point in time after that, the philosopher can unleash the effect with just one more word uttered. The target does not have to be present at this point in time. The target suffers a penalty determined by the number of WP spent (see cost) on all rolls except damage rolls until they can have a short rest. Chasm of Despair Requirements: Level 9, Stutters of Confusion Casting Time: reaction Range: 60 feet Duration: instantaneous Cost: 3 WP, invested until the target makes a successful saving throw Over the course of at least a short, possibly casual conversation, the philosopher can sow the seeds of blackest despair in the victim.This feature works like Stutters of Confusion, but instead of a penalty on rolls the victim gains 1 Dismay per day until a successful Wisdom saving throw is made (roll once per day). Dismay accumulated up to this point remains and can be dealt with as normal. Initial saving throw is Wisdom. Clear Sight Requirements: Level 9, The World Askew Casting Time: 1 action Range: self Duration: 1 hour Cost: 6 WP As the true seeing spell (except range is self only). This can be used in combination with The World Askew. Timely Intervention Requirements: Level 11 Casting Time: reaction Range: 60 feet Duration: instantaneous Cost: 5 WP With just a carefully placed word or jarringly discordant short phrase, the philosopher can hinder or disrupt attempts at any kind of activity, including ability checks, spellcasting or combat rolls. Unless the target makes a successful Wisdom saving throw, the action automatically fails. Timely Intervention is used as a reaction. Weave Mastery Your understanding of the world has reached far beyond that of ordinary people, and you can now see the world in such a way that you can manipulate it at the most basic level. The strands of creation itself are now subject to reweaving by your hand. The following Weave Mastery powers are available for you to master: Overcome Boundaries Requirements: Level 9, Timely Assistance Cost: 3 WP (in addition to the Assistance feature’s cost) This allows you to help others ignore common restrictions on abilities or spells, subject to GM veto, for example to pick a lock without thieves’ tools, or enable an artist to imbue true life, or a soul, into a living statue. This feature can only be used in conjunction with Timely Assistance, Martial Assistance and Arcane Assistance, but both powers will have to be paid for in WP. See the Assistance features for guidelines for ranges, damage etc. Acceptance in the World Requirements: Level 11 Casting Time: 1 action Range: sight Duration: 2 hours Cost: 6 WP Cloaked in the mantle of the World’s Weave, the philosopher can fit in anywhere, making him or her the ultimate infiltrator. As long as he doesn’t give himself away by offensive action or thoughtless speech to arouse suspicion, he will be accepted in any group’s midst as a matter of course, unquestioned. Should he draw attention to himself, matters change, granting another saving throw for each eligible target. A saving throw only applies if the infiltrated group has members of equal or higher level than the philosopher, otherwise acceptance will be automatic. Normally, each target with the required level is allowed a saving throw, though in those rare cases where that might be impractical (due to too many eligible targets) the GM can decide to just make one roll for the target group. Malleable Weave Requirements: Level 12, Knew It Casting Time: reaction Range: self Duration: special Cost: 2 WP per attack avoided The philosopher can bend the world to his whim – any attack or object coming his way at any point during a combat round and which he can see will miss automatically if he so desires. The Unyielding Weave Requirements: Level 15 Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Duration: 1 minute Cost: 4 WP / special Makes any spellcasting impossible within a radius of 30 feet around the philosopher (the effect remains centered on him if he moves around) unless the magic–user makes a successful Wisdom saving throw for every attempted spell. Spell effects already established when the power is activated are not affected. Spells originating outside the 30 foot radius sphere are not affected and can affect targets within the area of effect. The feature can be amended to allow selected characters to use magic, with an extra WP expenditure of 2 WP for each excepted character. Cast-Iron Weave Requirements: Level 18 Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Duration: 1 minute Cost: 4 WP / special For the duration, no actions are possible within a radius of 30 foot radius sphere around the philosopher; the effect moves with the philosopher. Affected characters will just stand around impotently, unable even to speak coherently unless they make a successful Wisdom saving throw against the philosopher’s spell save DC. The philosopher can move with difficulty (at 1/4 normal rate, rounded down) if he expends an extra WP, and can move normally if he expends 3 WP. The feature can be amended on the spot to allow selected characters to take actions, with an extra WP expenditure of 3 WP for each excepted character. Unaging Requirements: Level 19 Cost: – The philosopher ages at a much slower rate. Aging occurs at a rate of 1 year of aging for every 5 years elapsed. Mend the World / Break the World Requirements: Level 20 Casting Time: special Range: touch / special Duration: concentration / special Cost: special (minimum 2 WP) Just like a seamstress either mending a garment or ripping it apart, the philosopher can manipulate, repair or destroy the fragile connections between the worlds, especially those of fae and mortals, and the very fabric of the world. In the wrong hands, this power can cause untold destruction as it allows the direct manipulation of the forces of Possibility and Permanence. If one wanted to undo the millennia of work by the Faerie Queens, this is the way. Likewise, if one were to join forces with them, this is the power which could help them finish their work, especially if an entire group of philosophers were to act in unison.On a more practical scale, this power allows the philosopher to open or close (or even destroy) planar passageways and similar reality-defying constructs; recreate, manipulate or destroy the planar technology of the fae (or similar constructs) in general; change the ways the natural world behaves in small locales (the effects of gravity come to mind, for example); and whatever else the player and Game Master can agree on. This is an epic power that works best with poetic thinking, and a willingness to contribute to a satisfying, world-shaking endgame. Casting time and cost should be set by the GM according to the needs of the story, but as a rough guideline use the following: The GM sets the base time at 1 to 5 hours, depending on the difficulty, scale and intricacy of the task. The base cost is time × 2 Weave Points. The player then has the option to modify casting time, range and duration according to the table below: find the step in time, range or duration you want and note the extra cost. Repeat for each category you want to modify and add the costs.Basic range is touch, and basic duration is concentration For example , the philosopher wants to destroy a spatial connection between two fae-built cave systems located in different areas of the world. The GM sets the casting time at 3 hours, which makes the base cost 3 × 2 = 6 WP. Extra Weave Points Casting Time Range Duration 2 10 min. 30 ft. 1 min. 4 1 minute 300 ft. 1 h. 6 1 action sight permanent The player now wants to modify all three categories: casting time, range and duration. He is sorely pressed for time and wants to get it all done in 1 action. Looking at the table, he sees that this step costs 6 WP. As he still has lots of Weave Points left, he decides to step up the range to 30 feet just in case the effect in place was booby-trapped: another 2 WP are added to the cost. Finally, he decides the effort is only worth it if he destroys the passage for good; he makes the effect permanent for another 6 WP. Altogether he has now spent 6 (base) + 6 (time) + 2 (range) + 6 (duration) = 20 Weave Points. The philosopher takes a look at the arcane symbols on the cave walls, concentrates for a moment and annihilates the mystic portal with barely a thought.

        "name": "Pilgrim",
        "description": "On occasion, an individual undergoing deep meditation or a spiritual awakening senses a glimmer of cosmic truth just outside their mind’s reach. Pilgrims are individuals who, through sheer force of will, are able to reach through the cosmic veil and grasp a fragment of that truth for the briefest of moments. After this transformative experience, they discover an expanded sense of self and ability to manipulate primal forces of the universe known as Yin and Yang. Those that devote themselves to gaining further understanding and Enlightenment set out on an endless journey of self-discovery to align themselves with their cosmic truth. By undergoing a spiritual awakening, many individuals become aware of the Yin and Yang energies within them. Through rigorous training and introspection, they can tap into and utilize their Yin and Yang. In addition to strengthening their mind and body, those that achieve a high level of mastery can externalize their Yin and Yang to manipulate the elements and even the Yin and Yang of individuals around them. The way these powers manifest is often closely linked to the pilgrim’s spiritual journey and moral compass. Traditions The quest for Enlightenment is deeply personal and individual. The exact tenets and beliefs imprinted on a pilgrim vary from individual to individual. Some believe it their duty to help the less fortunate and better the world through altruistic acts, while others see themselves as enforcers of cosmic balance attempting to eliminate any force that would upset that balance. Citizens of Rokugan tend to know little of pilgrims and their powers, but most have heard at least one folk tale involving a change of heart spurred by a wanderer’s wise words or the unassuming mountain hermit using supernatural abilities to defend innocent villagers from calamity. Rokugan contains a number of philosophical organizations dedicated to this quest. Many pilgrims don’t have an affiliation with these organizations and philosophies, but some do. The Brotherhood of Shinsei. There are numerous monasteries across Rokugan where those who wish to seek Enlightenment can live alongside like-minded individuals in cloistered communities. Some of these monasteries are secluded away in high mountains or the wilderness, while others are in cities, where their inhabitants do good works in the hopes of bettering the lives of their fellow people. The teachings of Shinsei are interpreted in many ways, and some pilgrims find their way to their quest for Enlightenment by joining—or leaving—a group of monks. The Perfect Land Sect. One particularly significant religious group is the Perfect Land Sect. Based on a particular interpretation of Shinsei’s teachings, the Perfect Land Sect believes in the attainment of a “Perfect Land” within the afterlife within a single lifetime and rejects the Rokugani Celestial Order that most traditions embrace. This has put this sect in conflict with both other followers of Shinsei and with various samurai lords. A pilgrim from this sect might take their cosmic experience as a sign that the Perfect Land can indeed be reached, or they might be frustrated that they have been seemingly singled out by the cosmos when they are in truth no better than anyone else. Study of the Elements. Some pilgrims find their way to cosmic knowledge through study of Isawa’s treatise, Elements . Seeing the ways that the elements of Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Void can be understood through the contrast of Yin and Yang can lead a scholar with an open mind to this path. This document is part of most curriculums within the Phoenix Clan and read widely by many spiritualists across Rokugan. Those Who Wander Many pilgrims come to their journeys all on their own without seeking Enlightenment through some prior philosophy or organization. A martial artist who stands for hours beneath a waterfall to train endurance might suddenly feel a surge of the energy that sustains them, or a battlefield medic might see the life vanishing from their patient’s eyes and find a way to give some of their own to replace it. Individuals who have these experiences might seek out orders that profess a path to Enlightenment to try to understand their newfound powers, or they might eschew them entirely, preferring to learn on their own terms. Quick Builds Generally, make Constitution your highest ability score, as you derive both offensive and defensive benefits from improving your endurance and the flow of energy within your body. Depending on the cosmic path you intend to pursue at 2nd level, select Charisma (Path of Redemption), Wisdom (Path of Balance), or Intelligence (Path of Justice) as your next highest ability score. Several iconic pilgrims can be found in the more detailed quick builds provided in the Backgrounds section, such as the Asako Loremaster and Agasha Mystic.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per pilgrim level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per pilgrim level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Simple Weapons Tools: Choose one type of artisan’s tools of your choice Saving Throws: Constitution, Wisdom Skills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Medicine, Religion, Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) traveling clothes or (b) unremarkable garb. (a) any simple weapon. Cultivated Potential Beginning at 1st level, you gain an additional Hit Die (d8). Hit Dice gained through this feature do not increase your maximum hit points, but can be used normally to heal during short rests or used by effects that require Hit Dice to be expended. The amount of additional Hit Dice increases as you gain pilgrim levels, as shown in the Cultivated Potential column of the Pilgrim table. Strength of Body and Spirit Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. Additionally, you are proficient with your unarmed attacks. You can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed attacks, and you use a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. Yin and Yang Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to a unique resource meter: a balance track to reflect your Yin and Yang energy. Yin energy is covert, shadowy, receding, and palliative, evoking the power of the moon and the starry sky. Yang energy is overt, bright, advancing, and direct, evoking the glowing rays of the sun. Both are part of what it is to be alive, and both exist in all aspects of the universe in an eternal, swaying balance. A pilgrim’s energy travels along a seven-state balance track. In addition to having a passive bonus for being in that state, each state has a Yin and a Yang value that is used by some externalization abilities. The effects of each state are shown, below. Unless your cosmic path feature gained at 2nd level states otherwise, you begin each combat in the balanced state. At the end of each combat encounter, you return to your resting position on the Yin-Yang scale. Normally this is in the balanced position, but the cosmic path you choose can change this resting position. You can adjust your Yin and Yang state freely while out of combat. Certain effects adjust your energy one or more steps along the scale, usually toward the Yin or Yang apex as specified. This shift in your energy is mandatory unless the effect specifies otherwise. You can’t benefit from the bonuses granted to you by the Yin and Yang Balance Track if you are wearing armor. Battle Meditation Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to move one step in either direction along the Yin-Yang track. At 20th level, when you use this feature, you can move up to two steps instead. Table 2-8: Yin and Yang State Yin Yang Effects Yang Apex 0 4 You gain a +2 bonus to damage with unarmed attacks Yang Rising 1 3 You gain a +1 bonus to damage with unarmed attacks Neutral Energy: Path of Justice Resting Position 2 2 You gain a +2 bonus to passive Perception Neutral Energy: Path of Harmony Resting Position 2 2 You gain a +2 bonus to all of your saving throws Neutral Energy: Path of Redemption Resting Position 2 2 You gain a +2 bonus to passive Perception Yin Flowing 3 1 When you regain HP or cause another creature to regain HP, add +1 to the total Yin Apex 4 0 When you regain HP or cause another creature to regain HP, add +2 to the total Externalizations Starting at 2nd level, you can focus your emotions and energy through powerful techniques known as externalizations. Externalizations. Externalizations allow a pilgrim to project their energy out into the world around themselves to produce miraculous effects. Unlike the power of a ritualist, which is invoked from spirits and gods in the world, a pilgrim’s abilities are manifested by resonating their inner energy with the elements of the outer world. When a pilgrim uses an externalization, their energy shifts toward the other pole of Yin or Yang to balance out the change they have affected in the world. Externalizations are amplified by the pilgrim’s current Yin value or Yang value. To activate an externalization, you must spend 1 or more Hit Dice, and Hit Dice acquired by transforming into a different creature cannot be used this way. At 3rd level, you learn the following externalizations: Impetus of Rejuvenation You amplify a creature’s Yin energy, helping its body to heal itsel f rapidly. Activation : 1 action Ra nge: Touch Effects: You can spend your action to choose yourself or another creature within range. If you chose yourself, you can spend and roll a number of your Hit Dice up to your Yin value and immediately regain hit points equal to the total value of those Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier. Alternately, if you chose another creature, you and that creature can spend and roll one or more Hit Dice. These Hit Dice can come from you and that creature in any combination, but cannot exceed your Yin value in total. The chosen creature regains hit points equal to total result of the rolled dice + your Constitution modifier. Energy Shift: Move your energy one step toward the Yang apex for each result of 5 or higher among the Hit Dice the creature rolled. Resonating Strike You infuse your Yang energy into a strike, causing it to reverberate throughout the foe’s body and inflicting ong oing harm. Activation : 1 action Ra nge: Touch Effects: You can spend your action to make an unarmed attack against a creature in range. On a hit, you can roll and spend a number of Hit Dice up to your Yang value. At the end of its next turn, your target suffers radiant damage equal to 1d6 + your Constitution modifier. It suffers this radiant damage again at the end of each of its turns for number of rounds equal to the highest result among the Hit Dice you rolled. Using resonating strike on a creature already suffering from its effects does not increase the damage dealt but instead increases the number of rounds they are affected by the highest result among the Hit Dice you rolled. At 10th level, the damage is increased by an additional 1d6. Energy Shift: Move your energy one step toward the Yin apex for each result of 5 or higher among the Hit Dice you rolled. Externalization Attack Modifier. Some of your externalizations call for you to make an attack roll. Your attack modifier for these is calculated as described below: Externalization Attack Modifier = Your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier Externalization Save DC. Some of your externalizations call for your targets to make a saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is calculated as described below: Externalization Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your cosmic path’s attribute modifier (Charisma for Path of Redemption, Wisdom for Path of Harmony, and Intelligence for Path of Justice) Cosmic Path At 2nd level, you commit yourself to a cosmic path. Choose the Path of Redemption, Path of Harmony, or Path of Justice, detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, 17th and 20th level. Boundless Vitality Starting at 5th level, you suffer the effects of exhaustion as if you had one fewer levels of exhaustion. For example, if you have two levels of exhaustion, you suffer only the penalties of having one level, and if you have one level, you do not suffer any penalties at all. Additionally, when you complete a long rest, your exhaustion level decreases by two instead of one. Starting at 15th level, you suffer the effects of exhaustion as if you had two less levels of exhaustion. Well of Strength Starting at 5th level, you are able to push yourself past the physical limitations that restrain most people. On your turn, you can spend your full movement and gain one level of exhaustion to recover up to two of your expended Hit Dice. The amount of recovered Hit Dice increases to four at 10th, and six at 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Forms of Enlightenment Starting at 7th level, you can use your bonus action to enter a form of enlightenment. You can only enter a given form if you meet its Yin and Yang requirements. Activating a form of enlightenment ends the effect of any other form of enlightenment you had previously entered. At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to exit your current form of enlightenment. Each form of enlightenment has different effects. Form of Air You align your Yin energy to the wind and sky, moving in tune with the subtle gra ce of air. Activation Requirements: Yin flowing or Yin apex state While in the Form of Air, gain the following effects: Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. At the end of your turn, if you have moved more than 30 feet, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class against ranged attacks equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) until the start of your next turn. When you make a Dexterity check or Dexterity saving throw, after rolling the die, you can spend one Hit Die to roll it and add it to the result. At the end of your turn, move your energy one step toward the Yang apex, then if you are in the Yang rising or the Yang apex state, exit this form. Form of Earth You align your Yang energy to the subtle shifts of the earth, letting you move with inexorabl e purpose. Activation Requirements: Yang rising or Yang apex state While in Form of Earth, gain the following effects: When you take nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, reduce the total damage by your proficiency bonus. When you make a Constitution check or Constitution saving throw, after rolling the die, you can spend one Hit Die to roll it and add it to the result. At the end of your turn, move your energy one step toward the Yin apex, then if you are in the Yin rising or the Yin apex state, exit this form. Form of Fire You align your Yang energy to flame, and your power bursts forth from your body in torrent s of heat. Activation Requirements: Yang rising or Yang apex state While in Form of Fire, gain the following effects: When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack or externalization that deals damage, it takes additional fire damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus. When you make a Strength check or Strength saving throw, after rolling the die, you can spend one Hit Die to roll it and add it to the result. At the end of your turn, move your energy one step toward the Yin apex, then if you are in the Yin rising or the Yin apex state, exit this form. Form of Water You align your Yin energy to flowing water, letting you shift from stillness to rapid movement with the speed of a ripp ling pond. Activation Requirements: Yin flowing or Yin apex state While in Form of Water, gain the following effects: When you use an externalization or pilgrim feature that rolls Hit Dice, you can add or subtract your proficiency bonus to the result of one Hit Die rolled. You gain a second reaction each round. You cannot use more than one reaction per turn. When you make a Charisma check or Charisma saving throw, after rolling the die, you can spend one Hit Die to roll it and add it to the result. At the end of your turn, move your energy one step toward the Yang apex, then if you are in the Yang rising or the Yang apex state, exit this form. Form of Void You align your inner energies with the Void, the emptiness that is, paradoxically, the summation of the other four elements. Activation Requirements: Balanced state While in Form of Void, gain the following effects: When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack or externalization that deals damage, you can cause it to lose one of the following: 1 focus point, 1 favor, 1 intrigue die, an unused spell slot of the defender’s choice with level lower than or equal to your proficiency bonus, or another class or archetype resource at the GM’s discretion. If it has abilities with the Recharge keyword, the GM chooses one of those abilities to exhaust. When you make a Wisdom check or Wisdom saving throw, after rolling the die, you can spend one Hit Die to roll it and add it to the result. At the end of your turn, you must move one step toward your choice of the Yin or Yang apex, then if you are in a state other than balanced, exit this form. Advanced Externalizations At 9th level gain access to the following externalizations: Cleansing Touch You project your Yin energy into another person, dispelling a malaise or condition from them. Activation : 1 action Ra nge: Touch Effects: You can spend your action to choose a number of creatures in range up to your Constitution modifier. Spend and roll a number of Hit Dice up to your Yin value. For each die that is of the listed value or higher, you can remove one of the following conditions from a chosen character: 4 or higher: bleeding, disoriented, distracted, provoked 5 or higher: blinded, charmed, deafened, maimed, weakened 6 or higher: frightened, paralyzed, poisoned 7 or higher: invisible, marked for death, petrified 8 or higher: any one ongoing effect of a spell, invocation, externalization, or other magical effect the GM deems appropriate Energy Shift: Move your energy one step toward the Yang apex for each result of 5 or higher among the Hit Dice you rolled. Fearsome Leap You launch yourself forward with a burst of Yang energy, soaring upward with impressive velocity. Activation: 1 bonus action R ange: Self Effects: You can spend your bonus action on your turn to make a heroic leap or extend a jump you already began as part of an action (or any other way). Spend and roll a number of Hit Dice up to your Yang value. You leap 10 feet + 5 feet for each Hit Die with a result of 5 or higher, or extend your leap by that distance. You can’t be the target of opportunity attacks during this movement. When you land, you suffer no falling damage, and each creature within a 5-foot-sphere around you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On failure, a creature suffers radiant damage equal to the sum of the Hit Dice rolled and the disoriented condition (it can’t make opportunity attacks) until the end of your next turn. On a successful save they take half damage instead. Energy Shift: Move your energy one step toward the Yin apex for each result of 5 or higher among the Hit Dice you rolled. Infuse Energy You touch a creature and amplify its Yang energy, empowering its next strike to superhuma n heights. Activation: 1 bonus action Ra nge: Touch Effects: You can spend your bonus action to choose yourself or another creature within 5 feet. Spend and roll a number of Hit Dice up to your Yang value. The chosen creature’s next attack roll or multitarget attack roll before the end of its next turn has advantage, and the creature gains a bonus to damage equal to the total of the rolled Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier. Additionally, the creature’s walking speed is increased by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. Energy Shift: Move your energy one step toward the Yin apex for each result of 5 or higher among the Hit Dice you rolled. Technique Chaining Starting at 13th level, you become capable of chaining your strikes and externalizations together in rapid succession. Once per turn after you perform an externalization, you can make an unarmed attack, or you can expend one Hit Die to perform an additional externalization you have not performed this turn. You cannot perform the same externalization twice this way. E yes of Dawn and Dusk At 14th level, you gain proficiency in Wisdom (Perception) checks and can’t be blinded by sources of light, and can see creatures and spirits in their true form. Additionally, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet., and tremorsense to a range of 20 feet. Finally, you have advantage on checks and saving throws to perceive the truth behind illusions. Pilgrim Archetypes The following are three types of pilgrim. They are not the only types of pilgrims found in Rokugan, but they are some of the most iconic.

        "description": "Though you have not been granted the divine purpose of an adventuring cleric, you have nevertheless been ordained as a priest to one of the many gods. Your lot is that of a quieter life with the church: conducting services, looking after your congregation, performing community rituals, and other administrative duties. Even when whisked off into adventuring, your posture is that of an unassuming reverend, not an evangelizing cleric or crusading paladin. Prerequisites: Must be ordained by some faith Hit Dice: 1d8 Hit Points: 1d8 (5) + your Constitution modifier Skills: Religion Spellcasting This auxiliary level counts as a level in your Spellcasting or Pact Magic class (if you have a level in such a class) for the purpose of determining your available spell slots. However, it doesn’t advance your spells known and prepared. For example, if you are a Wizard 2/Priest, you have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots, but you only know 1st-level spells. Bonus Cantrips You learn the spare the dying cantrip and one additional cantrip of your choice from the cleric spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Channel Divinity You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Faith Healing and Turn Undead. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. Faith Healing. As an action, you can present your holy symbol and touch a willing Humanoid creature to mend its wounds. The creature rolls a number of d8s equal to half your level (rounded down) and regains that many hit points + your Wisdom modifier. This feature has no effect on Undead or Constructs. Turn Undead. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the Undead. Each Undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.",

The pain only makes her stronger. As she descends on the snarling pack she swings wildly, knocking several hobgoblins off their feet and sending the rest scattering before her. The human braces himself for the impact as the orc rushes him. Then the monster makes a mistake, telegraphing its next move, and that’s all the opening the human needs. He ducks beneath the orc’s wide swing then raises both hands high above his head and brings them down on the orc’s back, forcing the brute to the ground. The dwarf smiles broadly and chuckles as the petty noble raises his hand to strike him for the impudent remark. Quick as a flash, the dwarf shatters the bottle in his hand against the bar and brandishes it before the noble. The young dandy flinches, stumbles backward, and runs away as the dwarf turns back to the bar to order another round. Wherever they come from, pugilists live a rough and tumble life that leaves them full of determination and recklessness, either from overconfidence or desperation. In a fight, they can channel this strength of character to dig deep and fight off foes with greater strength of numbers, arms, or armor than anyone else would think possible. Swagger for Days Pugilists unconsciously tap into their own inner strength in the form of moxie. This is not an esoteric or mystical energy that flows through the multiverse, but the result of determination forged over a lifetime of hardship with a never-say-die attitude. You can teach someone how to fight but you could never teach someone how to be a pugilist. The secret of mastering moxie doesn’t come from disciplined study or rigorous training, it comes from years of wanting and needing. Life on the Street Every city in the worlds of D&D has its back alleys, its underground fighting rackets, its ghettos. The pugilists who live in these places don’t have time to consider the lofty ideals of philosophy or ponder the mysteries of the universe. The pugilists, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, spend all their time chasing down their next meal or, if they’re fortunate enough to have that, their next drink, bedfellow, or flophouse. For pugilists, becoming an adventurer might be the only way out of whatever miserable situation they’ve been stuck in since infancy. For others, getting lost out in the world is an escape from the tangled web of debt or enemies they’ve piled up. Other pugilists fight because it’s the only thing they know how to do. Whatever the reason for their adventuring, pugilists are as excited by the prospect of throwing punches as they are spending every last gold coin they earn. Hardship No one becomes as tough as a pugilist without enduring hardship and persevering. For a pugilist, suffering is a catalyst that reveals their unbreakable spirit and strength. These hardships also influence a pugilist in other ways. If you were raised on the street, you might have a special interest in looking after the poor and destitute. If you were jailed for a crime you didn’t commit, your relationship with the town guard might be more antagonistic than the average adventurer. Like so many other pugilists, your will was forged in the fires of adversity. What did you learn about yourself when you came out the other side? How does that experience continue to influence you today? Hardships d6 Hardship 1 A plague took your family when you were a child, leaving you to spend the rest of your youth in an orphanage. 2 You were harassed by the town guard then framed for a crime you did not commit. 3 You lost everything when a trusted friend betrayed you. 4 Your parents sold you to the thieves guild for less than a gold piece. 5 You drank your life away until you hit rock bottom and sobered up. 6 You refused to throw a match at a gang boss’s insistence and your family ended up paying the price. Favorite Dive Every hard-fighting hero needs a refuge where they can relax and rejuvenate. For pugilists, these sanctuaries tend to be disreputable. You might head to your favorite dive to indulge in your vice of choice or fraternize with the common folk. Some pugilists find the only way they can truly unwind is by getting bloodied in a fight. Others have a quiet side that few outside their closest companions ever see. How long has your favorite dive been your go-to spot? Do you have any friends or rivals that frequent the same place? Dives d6 Favorite Dive 1 A seedy tavern where brawls break out on a nightly basis. 2 An underground fight venue where people come to bet coin on the outcome. 3 A barbershop where they’re always eager to hear tales of your latest exploits. 4 A high stakes gambling den with games of skill and chance. 5 The orphanage you grew up in that was closed and abandoned some years ago. 6 A quiet library. Rumor Pugilists are frequent subjects of rumors and speculation. The combination of their resilience, might, and panache make them popular topics over a pint at the local tavern. Add to this most pugilists come from humble beginnings and it’s easy to see why the public comes up with such colorful stories about them. Whether or not it’s true, you have a particular rumor that follows you wherever you go. How do you feel about your reputation? Do you indulge rumormongers, or does the speculation about your background annoy you? Rumors d6 Rumor 1 You got your prodigious strength from suckling milk at the teet of a giantess. 2 You won a drinking competition against a dwarf...and then three more before the night was through. 3 The town guards hate you as much as their spouses love you. 4 You are an enforcer for one of the most powerful figures in the criminal underworld. 5 You wrestled an owlbear to the ground with such ease you fell asleep during the tussle. 6 Your daddy was an earth elemental, which is why your bones are made of iron. Creating a Pugilist As you build your pugilist, consider how you came to be a bare knuckle brawler. Did you learn to fight to defend yourself? Was scraping the natural result of your nose for trouble? Or did you learn to fight as a way of intimidating and controlling others? Were you fighting for the entertainment, or did you fight because you had to? Did you try to become a more traditional martial artist but just couldn’t hack it? Pugilists are a rowdy bunch that like to brag about how they learned to fight, so you better have a good story to tell. What events in your life gave you the sheer determination and will that pugilists call on? Did you spend every day hustling on the street to make ends meet? Were you forgotten and ignored by your family? Were you an outsider in your community who had to constantly struggle against the ignorant stereotypes the people there had of you? The most important element of the pugilist is that they are driven. Once you have decided what events made you into the pugilist you are today, decide how that may shape the actions you take in the future. Quick Build You can make a pugilist quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the criminal or urchin background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per pugilist level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per pugilist level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, improvised weapons, whip, hand crossbow Tools: Your choice of one artisan’s tools, gaming set, or thieves’ tools Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution Skills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth Starting Equipment You start with the following equipment in addition to the equipment gained by your background: ( a ) leather armor or ( b ) any simple weapon ( a ) a dungeoneer’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack ( a ) a set of artisan’s tools ( b ) a gaming set or ( c ) thieves’ tools Multiclassing and the Pugilist If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose pugilist as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character, you must have Strength and Constitution scores of at least 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a pugilist. Proficiencies Granted. If pugilist isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a pugilist: light armor, improvised weapons. Fisticuffs At 1st level, your years of fighting in back alleys and taverns have given you mastery over combat styles that use unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons, which are simple melee weapons without the two-handed property, whips, and improvised weapons. You can’t use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a pugilist weapon. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or using only pugilist weapons and you are wearing light or no armor and not using a shield: You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or pugilist weapon. This die changes as you gain pugilist levels, as shown in the Fisticuffs column on the Pugilist table. When you use the Attack action on your turn and make only unarmed strikes, attacks with pugilist weapons, shoves, or grapples, you can use a bonus action to make one grapple or unarmed strike. Iron Chin Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing light or no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 12 + your Constitution modifier. Moxie Starting at 2nd level, your experience laying the beatdown on others has given you a moxie you can channel in the midst of battle. This swagger is represented by a number of moxie points. Your pugilist level determines the maximum number of points you have, as shown in the Moxie Points column of the Pugilist table. You can spend these points to fuel various moxie features. You start knowing three such features: Brace Up, The Old One-Two, and Stick and Move. You learn more moxie features as you gain levels in this class. You regain all expended moxie points when you finish a short or long rest. Brace Up You can use a bonus action and spend 1 moxie point to brace for attacks. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to a roll of your fisticuffs die + your pugilist level + your Constitution modifier. You lose any remaining temporary hit points gained in this way after 1 minute. The Old One-Two Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 moxie point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. Stick and Move You can use a bonus action and expend 1 moxie point to attempt to shove a creature or take the Dash action. Street Smart Beginning at 2nd level, carousing, shadowboxing, and sparring all count as light activity for the purposes of resting for you. Additionally, once you have caroused in a settlement for 8 hours or more, you know all public locations in the city as if you were born and raised there and you cannot be lost by nonmagical means while within the city. Bloodied but Unbowed Starting at 3rd level, when you take damage that reduces you to half your maximum hit points or less, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to three times your pugilist level and regain all your expended moxie points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Fight Club Starting at 3rd level, you choose a fight club that best exemplifies your style: Arena Royale, Bloodhound Bruisers, Dog & Hound, Hand of Dread, Lead Eaters, Paradox Consortium, Piss & Vinegar, Relentless Revenant, Rift Hitter, the Squared Circle, or the Sweet Science, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your fight club grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Dig Deep Starting at 4th level, you discover a strength inside you that can’t be broken. As a bonus action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for one minute. At the end of that minute, you gain a level of exhaustion. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Haymaker Starting at 5th level, when you make an attack, you can declare you are swinging a wild haymaker. When you do, you have disadvantage on the attack roll and, if you hit with a pugilist weapon or unarmed strike, you deal the maximum result of your weapon’s damage die instead of rolling. Moxie-Fueled Fists Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. Fancy Footwork At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. Shake It Off Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. Down but Not Out Starting at 9th level, when you use your Bloodied But Unbowed feature, you can choose to also use this feature. If you do, you add your proficiency bonus to the damage of your unarmed strikes and pugilist weapons for the next minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. School of Hard Knocks By 10th level, you’ve graduated top of the class at the school of hard knocks and you took most of them on the head. You have resistance to psychic damage and have advantage on saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or unconscious. Rabble Rouser Starting at 13th level, word of your exploits travels quickly in cities and other settlements. Once you have taken a long rest in a settlement during which time you spend at least two hours carousing, you gain advantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) rolls made against the people who live there. Unbreakable Starting at 14th level, you gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 moxie point to reroll it and take the second result. Herculean Starting at 15th level, your carrying capacity is doubled, and when you deal damage with a melee weapon or unarmed strike to an inanimate object, that damage is doubled. Your standing jump distance is the same as your running start jump distance. Fighting Spirit Starting at 18th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can channel your fighting spirit. When you do, you regain half of your maximum hit points, half of your maximum moxie points, and do not suffer the effects of any levels of exhaustion you have for the next 10 minutes. At the end of those 10 minutes, you gain a level of exhaustion. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Peak Physical Condition At 20th level, your Strength and Constitution ability scores increase by 2, to a maximum of 22. Additionally, when you take a long rest, you recover 2 levels of exhaustion instead of 1 and you regain all your expended Hit Dice instead of only half. Fight Clubs Despite the name, fight clubs are not formal fraternities or sororities, but collections of pugilists who, bytraining or happenstance, share a similar style. In some D&D worlds, fight clubs can tell you a lot about where a person comes from, while in others there are representatives of many fighting styles in all metropolitan areas.

Choose a type of favored enemy : aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. Natural Explorer You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. Your group can't become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level. Spellcasting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list . You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Ranger Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such as the Hunter. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Land's Stride Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. Hide in Plain Sight Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. Vanish Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. Feral Senses At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened . Foe Slayer At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. Ranger Archetypes A classic expression of the ranger ideal is the Hunter. Hunter Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons. Hunter’s Prey At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. Colossus Slayer : Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. Giant Killer : When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. Horde Breaker : Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon. Defensive Tactics At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. Escape the Horde : Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage . Multiattack Defense : When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn. Steel Will : You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened . Multiattack At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. Volley : You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target. Whirlwind Attack : You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. Superior Hunter’s Defense At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice. Evasion : When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Stand Against the Tide : When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice. Uncanny Dodge : When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.",

        "description": "Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another. After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales. Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbea⁠r he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow. Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch. Deadly Hunters Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding⁠ themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes. Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells⁠, like their combat⁠ abilities⁠, emphasize speed, stealth⁠, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities⁠ are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands. Independent Adventurers Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense. This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways. Creating a Ranger As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat⁠ skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds. What’s the source of your particular hatred⁠ of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer? Quick Build You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d10 per ranger level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light⁠ armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity Skills: Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth⁠, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: ( a ) scale mail or ( b ) leather armor ( a ) two shortswords or ( b ) two simple melee weapons ( a ) a dungeoneer’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows Favored Enemy Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. Natural Explorer You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. Your group can’t become lost except by magical means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Spellcasting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See\"Casting a Spell\" for the general rules of spellcasting and \"Ranger Spells by Level\" for the ranger spell list. Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship ⁠ using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level⁠ and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells⁠ of your choice. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement⁠ to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Ranger Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Primeval Awareness Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Land’s Stride Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. Hide in Plain Sight Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. Vanish Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. Feral Senses At 18th level, you gain preternatural se⁠nses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your atta⁠ck rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened. Foe Slayer At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an atta⁠ck you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells , which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class’s description. Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+ . You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells . Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger , your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells . Level 1: Favored Enemy You always have the Hunter’s Mark spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest . The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the Ranger Features table. Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords . Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords . Level 2: Deft Explorer Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits. Expertise. Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise . You gain Expertise in that skill. Languages. You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in chapter 2 . Level 2: Fighting Style You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5 ). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below. Druidic Warrior. You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a list of Druid spells ). Guidance and Starry Wisp are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip . Level 3: Ranger Subclass You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. The Beast Master , Fey Wanderer , Gloom Stalker , and Hunter subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 6: Roving Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor . You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed . Level 9: Expertise Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise . You gain Expertise in those skills. Level 10: Tireless Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits. Temporary Hit Points. As a Magic action , you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . Decrease Exhaustion. Whenever you finish a Short Rest , your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1. Level 13: Relentless Hunter Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on Hunt er’s Mark . Level 14: Nature’s Veil You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action , you can give yourself the Invisible condition until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest . Level 17: Precise Hunter You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature currently marked by your Hunt er’s Mark . Level 18: Feral Senses Your connection to the forces of nature grants you Blindsight with a range of 30 feet. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended. Level 20: Foe Slayer The damage die of your Hunter’s Mark is a d10 rather than a d6. Ranger Spell List This section presents the Ranger spell list.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class’s description. Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+ . You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells. Level 1: Favored Enemy You always have the Hunter’s Mark spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest. The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the Ranger Features table. Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords. Level 2: Deft Explorer Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits. Expertise. Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in that skill. Languages. You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in chapter 2. Level 2: Fighting Style You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below. Druidic Warrior. You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a list of Druid spells). Guidance and Starry Wisp are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip. Level 3: Ranger Subclass You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. The Beast Master, Fey Wanderer, Gloom Stalker, and Hunter subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Extra Attack You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Level 6: Roving Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed. Level 9: Expertise Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack Expertise. You gain Expertise in those skills. Level 10: Tireless Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits. Temporary Hit Points. As a Magic action, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. Decrease Exhaustion. Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1. Level 13: Relentless Hunter Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on Hunt er’s Mark . Level 14: Nature’s Veil You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the Invisible condition until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. Level 17: Precise Hunter You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature currently marked by your Hunt er’s Mark . Level 18: Feral Senses Your connection to the forces of nature grants you Blindsight with a range of 30 feet. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended. Level 20: Foe Slayer The damage die of your Hunter’s Mark is a d10 rather than a d6. Ranger Spell List This section presents the Ranger spell list.

Though its iron is rusted and its wood is stained with blood, an unseen power weights its swing, and you can feel an intelligence echoing within it. Once you bind with it, the weapon is linked with your soul, and it grows in power as you do. Prerequisites: None Hit Dice: 1d10 Hit Points: 1d10 (6) + your Constitution modifier Sentient Weapon When you gain this level, you acquire a sentient magic weapon that bonds to your very soul and grows in might as you do. Your weapon is your choice of any martial weapon that lacks the Two Handed property. Once made, this decision can’t be changed. You can use your action to summon your sentient weapon to your open hand. You are proficient with it while you wield it. Magic Weapon. The weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you reach 5th level, your bond with the weapon strengthens, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. At 11th level, your bond strengthens further, and you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. Relic Magic. Your relic weapon has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you use the Attack action to make an attack with your relic weapon, you can spend 1 of its charges to make an attack using it as a bonus action. Additionally, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can siphon some of the energy into the weapon. The next time you hit a creature with the weapon during the next minute, you deal extra force damage equal to twice the spell’s level. Sentience. The weapon is a sentient magic item with an alignment and personality determined by the GM. It has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. The weapon has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can speak, read, and understand Common, as well as communicate with you telepathically. I prefer my weapons silent.

        "name": "Ritualist",
        "description": "Ritualists are characters who wield a rare talent: the ability to speak to the many spirits that inhabit Rokugan and the lands beyond. Through rigorous training in mystical secrets, a unique individual relationship with a spirit, or innate inclination, some people are capable of invocations. Each of these techniques is an appeal to a particular spirit or elemental force, drawing its power into the Mortal Realm as the ritualist desires. Clan Traditions Each of the Great Clans has at least one ritualist tradition, and these groups protect their secrets and the spiritual power they wield carefully. Crab Clan Traditions. The Kuni Purifiers master knowledge and prayers to deny the Shadowlands forces any foothold inside the Empire. To this end, they have specialized in invocations to the earth spirits to vanquish beings of the Shadowlands. From the time of their school’s founding, the Kuni Purifiers have sought to understand the nature of the threat the Crab Clan must combat. This has led them down dangerous paths, and no small number have fallen to the very corruption they study. Unlike most ritualist traditions, Kuni Purifiers have no central academy or place of learning; instead, each Purifier takes on one student at a time, training them as an apprentice as they journey across Crab lands and beyond seeking threats to Rokugan. Crane Clan Traditions. Art and religion intertwine for the Asahina family, for to them, faith, beauty, and peace are all aspects of the same truth. Once a part of the Phoenix Clan, the Asahina family split to join the Crane Clan in centuries past, and has become especially philosophical in its teachings in the time since. The family’s doctrine teaches that through the creation of works of arcane artistry, their students can enrich the world around them and improve the lives of everyone. While they are capable of fighting, the Asahina family teaches that pacifism is the best solution to many problems, and so many Asahina Artificers prefer to focus on healing and defense in their invocations, as well as the creation of ornate charms to protect and guide their holders. Dragon Clan Traditions. The Agasha Mystics mix practical knowledge with their invocations, using alchemical items and metallurgy as foci for their mystical arts. Through this, they have learned to distill invocations into potions that they can imbibe or throw for powerful effect. Their chemical expertise enhances their magic further, which they use for everything from simple entertainment to warfare. Unlike some of the more cloistered traditions of ritualists, Agasha Mystics are encouraged by their teachers to venture out into the world, looking for new inspiration from nature in all its multitude of forms. Lion Clan Traditions. The smallest of the ritualist traditions of the Great Clans, the Kitsu Medium School maintains close relationships with many ancestral spirits who exist in the afterlife. This mystical connection to their forebears gives them unique insights into spiritual matters, allowing a single ritualist to channel lifetimes of experience. Kitsu Mediums are the living bridge between the Lion Clan’s past and the present, surpassing even mortality and time with their mystical secrets. Phoenix Clan Traditions. No tradition has a more complete mastery of the way of the spirits than that of the Isawa Elementalist School. Since their ancestors arrived in the land that would become Rokugan ,the priests of the Isawa tradition have sought knowledge and understanding of the spirits of the land, the Celestial Realms, and the very elements themselves. Their students train in elemental academies, each dedicated to learning how best to channel the spirits of a particular element. Another very different tradition of ritualists also exists within the Phoenix Clan. Kaito Shrine Keepers are the caretakers of an ancient tradition of liaising with the spirits from before the foundation of Rokugan. They work alongside priests to protect temples across Phoenix lands, or keep shrines on their own where they teach their traditions. The Kaito learn mystical arts to propitiate the spirits—sometimes even serving as vessels for them—and practical ones to maintain the shrines. Shrine Keepers make use of magic such as inscribed paper charms and spiritually enhanced soul-star arrows to defend their shrines against threats both mystical and mundane. Scorpion Clan Traditions . The Soshi Illusionist School is the school of whispers and shadows. “Subtlety” is the illusionists’ watchword as they go about their tasks. Even their religious rituals and duties tend to be understated, though they are no less faithfully executed. Their illusions are the finest in the Emerald Empire—so effective, in fact, that few people realize just how lifelike they are, having perhaps seen them in use without ever registering it. Far less subtle than the Soshi tradition but no less important, the Yogo Wardmaster dōjō is the Empire’s foremost school of supernatural warding through mystical calligraphy. Entrusted with the protection of the twelve Black Scrolls at the dawn of the Empire and many other dangerous artifacts since, the Yogo developed their founder’s techniques to prevent the scrolls’ detection by the malevolent powers of the world. By inscribing sigils of power onto slips of paper, they can prepare invocations in advance to be ready for any contingency. Unicorn Clan Traditions. The Unicorn understanding of magic and the spirits has been greatly influenced by their years exploring outside the Empire, and the making of magical artifacts remains the focus of their craft, the way of names. Using words of power learned during their foreign journeys, they call forth the powers of spirits. Their particular spiritual art makes the Iuchi one of the most open-minded of ritualist traditions, seeking out and using novel forms of spiritual power. Many members of the Unicorn Clan have also adopted the religious traditions of the Ujik peoples of the Plains of Wind and Stone, such as their reverence of deities of earth and sky, as well as the Lords of Death, benevolent ancestral protectors said to ride alongside the Ujik as they guide their herds or march to battle. Othe r Religious Figures Not every priest, shrine attendant, or other religious figure in Rokugan is a ritualist in the sense of being able to channel mystical powers. Many of these individuals pursue the social and theological aspects of religion without using powerful or flashy invocations, and are important members of their community. In fact, trained ritualists capable of performing invocations are quite rare, and only the Great Clans and other samurai of rank are likely to have access to such individuals on demand. A village priest is unlikely to be a ritualist in a mechanical sense, and while a spirit might come to their aid, it would likely do so in the manner of its choosing rather than responding directly to their invocation. Speak ers of the Wild On the other hand, some people who wield the power of invocations have received no formal religious training at all. These spiritualists, diviners, and sages have instead developed a knack for quickly building positive relationships with the spirits in the world around them. Usually untrained in formal rites or versed in secret knowledge, they use their powers more intuitively. Many have a uniquely close bond with a specific spirit whose power they can invoke, but do not know as many different spirits or the offerings and acts needed to wield their power. Their methods are often individualized, created entirely by trial and error and thus very well-tailored to their specific needs or that of their community. Some ritualists see individuals such as these as a threat to their own position of spiritual authority, while others recognize that they often develop unique insights or knowledge that other ritualists can learn a great deal by studying. Quick Builds Determine the archetype you intend to pursue at 2nd level, then make the corresponding ability score your highest ability score (Intelligence for Elementalist, Wisdom for Medium, or one of several options for Artisan based on your chosen art). If you want to wield your invocations alongside ranged or melee attacks, make Strength or Dexterity your next highest ability score. If you intend to fight entirely with your powers, make Constitution your next highest score instead. Several iconic ritualists of Rokugan can be found in the more detailed quick builds provided in the Backgrounds section, such as the Kuni Purifier, Kitsu Medium, and Isawa Elementalist.

Invocations and Favor You have access to powerful invocations, allowing you to call upon the might of the spirits to protect yourself, smite your foes, or perform supernatural feats. Invocations have five possible elements (Any, Air, Earth, Fire, or Water) and several possible tiers that become available to you as you progress in level (tier 0, tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3). Favor Invocations reflect a bond between yourself and various spirits, and favor is an abstract reflection of the willingness of spirits to go above and beyond to assist you. Invocations reflect a bond between yourself and various spirits, and favor is an abstract reflection of the willingness of spirits to aid you. When you perform an invocation, you must spend favor equal to its base favor cost to perform it. Additionally, you can spend additional favor to add potent effects to the invocation. You start with an amount of favor determined by your ritualist level, shown in the Maximum Favor column of the Ritualist table. Spent favor is restored after you complete a long rest or after you spend at least four hours performing tasks to spiritually align yourself in a spiritually active place like a shrine or pristine glen. These tasks might include quiet contemplation, making small offerings, or conversation with a spirit you know well. Picking Invocations for Ritualists If it’s your first time building a ritualist and you’re feeling overwhelmed by the options for tier 1 invocations, consider selecting the following options to start: Call of Cinders. This invocation lets you inflict fire damage on your foes, giving you a solid ranged attack as part of your arsenal. It can also be used to light and extinguish fires, which is often useful while adventuring. Path to Inner Peace. This invocation stimulates a wounded ally’s natural healing, helping them to recover more quickly from harm. Invocations Known You know the following tier 0 invocations: commune with the spirits , divine the omens , and threshold barrier . You also know two tier 1 invocations of your choice. The Invocations Known columns of the Ritualist table shows when you learn more invocations of your choice. Each of these invocations must be of a tier that is available to you, as shown on that table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation of the same tier. Save DC and Attack Modifier Different ritualists practice in different ways; some are studious scholars of sacred texts, others are spiritualists who find the sacred in the mundane world, and others still are bombastic orators who persuade people and spirits alike through their personal charisma. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your invocation ability. You use this ability score whenever an invocation refers to your invocation ability. In addition, you use this ability score’s modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an invocation you perform and when making an invocation attack roll. Invocation save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + chosen ability score modifier Invocation attack modifier = proficiency bonus + chosen ability score modifier Ritualist Tradition At 2nd level, you choose an archetype that reflects your way of wielding your influence. Choose Artisan, Elementalist, or Medium, detailed at the end of this class description. The tradition you choose grants you features at 2nd level, and again at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 20th level. Channeling At 3rd level, your spiritual bonds deepen. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover favor equal to your proficiency bonus or your ritualist level, whichever is lower. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Instinctive Invocation At 10th level, in addition to using the invocations you have learned, your spiritual potency allows you to instinctively reach out to unfamiliar spirits in times of need. You can perform one invocation of your choice that you do not know, treating its base favor cost as double. After you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you complete a long rest. Practiced Appeals Starting at 18th level, you know how to reach even faraway spirits with your words. You can spend your action to gain favor equal to your proficiency bonus. You can’t use this feature again until you complete a long rest. Ritualist Archetypes There are many different spiritual practices of Rokugan and the neighboring lands. Each family that maintains a school or tradition for training ritualists seeks to uncover new secrets while protecting the mystical knowledge it has obtained from its rivals. As such, there is a high degree of divergence between spiritual traditions. Some are skillful Artisans who craft potent artifacts imbued with the power of spirits. Others are Elementalists who channel spiritual powers more directly, hurling gouts of flame or walking on air. Still others are Mediums who draw spiritual powers into themselves, summoning the strength of spiritual guardians to battle or accessing knowledge from beyond their own senses’ reach.

        "description": "Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter⁠ friend moves forward to kick the door open. A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound. Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape. Rogues rely on skill, stealth⁠, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party. Skill and Precision Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat⁠ abilities⁠, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth⁠ and deception, while others refine the ski⁠lls that help them in a dungeon environm⁠ent, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute stren⁠gth. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the at⁠tack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities⁠. A Shady Living Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers. As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in sea⁠ch of treasure⁠. Creating a Rogue As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal⁠ past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in sea⁠rch of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal? What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents. Quick Build You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan background.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light⁠ armor Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords Tools: Thieves’ tools Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence Skills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth⁠ Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a rapier or ( b ) a shortsword ( a ) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or ( b ) a shortsword ( a ) a burglar’s pack, ( b ) a dungeoneer’s pack, or ( c ) an explorer’s pack Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools Expertise At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. Sneak Attack Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the atta⁠ck roll. The atta⁠ck must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attac⁠k roll. The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. Thieves’ Cant During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message⁠ than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Roguish Archetype At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Roguish Archetypes Rogues have many features in com⁠mon, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus - not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. Thief You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ. Fast Hands Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check , use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. Second-Story Work When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. Supreme Sneak Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Use Magic Device By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. Thief’s Reflexes When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised .",

Sleight of Hand and Stealth are recommended if you have proficiency in them. At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Level 1: Sneak Attack You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon . The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type. You don’t need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition, and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll . The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table . Level 1: Thieves’ Cant You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in chapter 2 . Level 1: Weapon Mastery Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows . Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords . Level 2: Cunning Action Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action : Dash , Disengage , or Hide . Level 3: Rogue Subclass You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Arcane Trickster , Assassin , Soulknife , and Thief subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Rogue level or lower. Level 3: Steady Aim As a Bonus Action , you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16. Level 5: Cunning Strike You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack . When you deal Sneak Attack damage , you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack ’s damage before rolling. If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw , the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus . Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw . On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit on your person. Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller , it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks . Level 5: Uncanny Dodge When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll , you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down). Level 7: Evasion You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage , you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition. Level 7: Reliable Talent Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies , you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage , paying the die cost for each effect. Level 14: Devious Strikes You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options. Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw , or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action . Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw , or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage . The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw , or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn. Level 15: Slippery Mind Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws . Level 18: Elusive You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have Advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended. Level 20: Stroke of Luck You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a D20 Test , you can turn the roll into a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest .

They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows. Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

        "name": "Sentinel",
        "description": "A stonefang matokai writhes through a hail of enemy fire in a shimmering blur, cleaving into her enemy with a furious blow. A heavily armored kesh stands toe to toe with a gigantic mecharoid, blocking enemy fire while his companions attack from afar. Her body aglow with solar energy, a scorched human unleashes a searing beam from her blade into kotatu stalker, sending the startled beast to the ground. Where many espers manipulate energies or make use of tools and drones, sentinels directly integrate themselves with their sorium device, transforming themselves into powerhouses of force, mighty defenders, and unyielding avengers. Enhanced Through Biotech The calling of an esper is seen differently through the eyes of a sentinel. Their complete integration with sorium-based tech has not only changed their perspective of the world around them, but gifted them with a realization of who they truly are. Each sentinel has a personalized harness that fuses matter with their physical form. This biomolecular bond with the cosmic material is a jolt to a sentinel’s senses, channeling power directly from the sun and stars above. Some believe such an alien bond would take away a piece of one’s soul. Whether this is true or not, a sentinel wouldn’t have it any other way. Honoring the Code On the surface, many sentinels can be mistaken as brutes who exchanged a bit of their humanity to become war machines. This is the far from true for any sentinel. No sentinel sees themselves as just any merc or tech-slinging goon. Whenever a sentinel attunes with their harness, they gain a greater sense of purpose— almost as if they are a part of a secret order, hidden within their universe. Whether it is for the benefit of others or their own is different for each sentinel, but all are connected somehow by this silent contract to which they are bound. Those who understand the nature of sentinels know full well that it is this code that makes them something more than just common brutes. Creating a Sentinel Upon choosing to create a sentinel, decide what level of integration your character has with their sorium harness, as well as how it affects your appearance and lifestyle. Some sentinels keep their harness concealed or cover them up, while others display their augmentations proudly, even decorating them with matching trinkets or attachments. Ability Scores Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Dexterity and Constitution are both useful as a tertiary option.

Hit Points Hit Dice : 1d10 per sentinel level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per sentinel level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: All armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Cybersmith’s tools Saving Throws: Charisma, Constitution Skills: Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Mechanics, Medicine, Perception and Persuasion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons (a) 10 throwing knives or (b) any simple weapon (a) heavy trooper armor or (b) medium trooper armor (a) a soldier’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack a sentinel’s rig Sentinel’s Rig At 1st level, You have a personalized rig, which is fitted with a set of sorium materials, tools, and attachments used to activate and implement your techniques. Your rig is integrated into your body, most often taking the form of a metallic harness bound to your torso. It is considered to be a part of your body and cannot be removed. You can use your bonus action and expend a tech slot to make your rig invisible to mundane senses, but it is still detectable by special senses such as truesight and talents such as esper sense . Your rig remains hidden for a number of hours equal to your sentinel level or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on an esper power). Once you reach 5th level, concealing your rig no longer requires you to expend a tech slot. When your rig is hidden in this way, you cannot use any techniques or your weapon link feature (see the Weapon Link feature described later). Between Body and Harness There have been many theories on what truly happens when a sentinel integrates with their harness, which draws its power from the stars and celestial bodies between them. It is a far more extensive bond then those who are fitted with sorium implants. Scientists who study the effects of the Crucibles have always believed they are imbued with a programming code which even the most brilliant of scientists have only scratched the surface toward fully understanding. However, going upon their basic theory, the integration of the sorium harness and its connection to the Crucibles may be the source of this inner voice that guides each sentinel toward their path. Whether this is just some base code within the Crucibles themselves, or perhaps even a form of AI, no one can truly say for certain. Regenerative Force Starting at 1st level, you can use the energy stored in your rig to regenerate living tissue. You have a regenerative pool that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your sentinel level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your regenerative pool to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Regenerative Force, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on automatons or constructs. Weapon Link Your rig’s attachments enable you to create a weapon link—a bio-molecular link between your rig and a melee weapon of your choice. Forging a weapon link takes 1 hour, which can be completed during a short rest. You can instantly dismiss your weapon link, the weapon dismantling itself and becoming a part of your harness. You can spend a bonus action to recall the weapon or summon it from any location to appear directly into your hand. Once the weapon has been forged into a weapon link, you cannot be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. Your weapon link is instantly dismissed into your rig if it is more than 10 feet away from you. You can have up to two weapon links, but can draw only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to create a weapon link with a third weapon, you must break the link with one of the other two. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Range Deterrence If a creature within 5 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature. Zone Defender As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach. Forging By 2nd level, you have learned to use the energy stored in your rig to power techniques, much like an engineer. Preparing and Using Techniques The Sentinel table shows how many tech slots you have to use for techniques. To activate a technique, you must expend a tech slot of the technique’s rank or higher. You regain all expended tech slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of techniques that are available for you to use, choosing from the sentinel powers list. When you do so, choose a number of techniques equal to your Charisma modifier + half your sentinel level, rounded down (minimum of one technique). The techniques must be of a rank for which you have tech slots. For example, if you are a 5th-level sentinel, you have four rank 1 and two rank 2 tech slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared techniques can include four rank 1 and rank 2 techniques, in any combination. If you prepare the rank 1 technique mend , you can activate it using a rank 1 or a rank 2 tech slot. Using the technique doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared techniques. You can change your list of prepared techniques when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of sentinel techniques for use requires at least 1 minute per technique level for each technique on your list. Forging Ability Charisma is your forging ability for your sentinel techniques, communing with your rig harness to implement your powers. You use your Charisma whenever a technique refers to your forging ability. In addition, you use you Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a technique you use and when making an attack roll with one. Forging save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Forging attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Infused Strike Also beginning at 2nd level, you can cause your weapon link to erupt with cosmic energy during combat. Whenever you use this feature, you can choose between one of the following options: Melee Strike When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack using your weapon link, you can expend one tech slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a rank 1 technique slot, plus 1d8 for each slot rank higher than 1, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an automaton or a construct. Ranged Strike You can use your action to fire a radiant beam from your weapon link at a target within 60 feet of you that you can see. Make a ranged forging attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant damage. You can also expend a tech slot to deal additional radiant damage as if you had hit the target with a melee strike. You can perform a ranged strike a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain all uses after you complete a short or long rest. Cellular Resistance By 3rd level, the cosmic energy flowing through you makes you immune to disease. Sentinel’s Path At 3rd level, you fully integrate with your harness, adopting a path and code of ethics that defines you as a sentinel. Up to this time you had been slowly adopting your true purpose but not yet fully committed to it. Your path not only defines you as an esper, but as the enlightened individual with a true objective in the galaxy. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include expanded techniques and the Rig Expansion feature. Expanded Powers Each path has a list of associated techniques. You gain access to these techniques at the levels specified in the path description. Once you gain access to one of these techniques, you always have it prepared. They don’t count against the number of techniques you can prepare each day. If your path grants you an esper power that doesn’t appear on the sentinel powers list, the power is nonetheless a sentinel technique for you. Rig Expansion Your rig integration allows you to channel its energy to fuel additional effects. Each Rig Expansion option provided by your path explains how to use it. When you use your Rig Expansion, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Rig Expansion again. Some Rig Expansion effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your sentinel forging save DC. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Multi-User Tactical Display Starting at 6th level, you can sync with nearby allies, providing them with an augmented reality display of incoming threats. Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you is required to make a saving throw, they gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range of this feature increases to 30 feet. Expanded Tactical Display Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be surprised while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this feature increases to 30 feet. Amplified Strike By 11th level, you master your attunement with your weapon link, and your weapon strikes carry residual cosmic energy. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack using your weapon link, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Infused Strike with your weapon link, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Infused Strike. Pattern Absorption Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end the effects of one esper power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. Sentinel Paths The calling of a sentinel is gained upon their first integration with their sorium rig. The cosmic energies within fuse with the sentinel’s inner persona, culminating into a full-fledged evolution when they reach 3rd level. When a sentinel chooses their path, they gain an expanded sense of connection with the very stars spiraling throughout the galaxy, something only that can only be described by other sentinels. Upon this awakening, each sentinel gains their sense of purpose. Path of the Champion Path of the Slayer",

        "name": "Shinobi",
        "description": "In the shadows stand those who act as samurai cannot. Beyond the strictures of the Code of Akodo , beyond the laws of society, beyond the polite fictions of court are the knives in the dark: shinobi. These spies, infiltrators, and assassins are often deniable assets, and many were never samurai; however, some members of the samurai caste are trained in these arts, especially among the Scorpion Clan. Most shinobi place loyalty to their lord above all other virtues, forsaking glory and accolades for the certain knowledge that their service is vital to their lord or all of Rokugan itself. Shinobi are masters of espionage and reconnaissance. While the Empire might publicly condemn the use of shinobi, few clans do not secretly train and utilize them. Shinobi tend to be secretive, and they often don disguises or construct secret identities to use while operating. Many shinobi dedicate their talents exclusively to furthering the goals of their lord or clan, others sell their services to the highest bidder, be they lords or criminal organizations. While competent fighters, shinobi tend to avoid head on conflicts. When forced to fight, the shinobi’s preferred method of engagement involves catching their opponents off guard with stealth and a wide array of tools and poisons. Clan Traditions Officially, none of the Great Clans of Rokugan admit to using covert operatives, but the truth is that all of them have agents trained in less-than-chivalrous means. It is widely known that many members of the Scorpion Clan train in such clandestine arts, but all seven Great Clans have their own secretive organizations and traditions they use when necessary. Crab Clan. In its war to contain the spreading corruption of the Shadowlands, the Crab Clan uses many tactics that would face Imperial censure if used against other samurai. The Hiruma family trains its scouts in the arts of poisoning and setting traps to bring down massive Shadowlands horrors, while the Yasuki family’s many business connections include dealings with countless criminal operations across the Emerald Empire. Within the Crab Clan, these are simply viewed as necessities of a constant and never-ending war. Crane Clan. The Crane Clan’s Daidoji family is best known for its heroic heavy infantry, but it also maintains a secret tradition dedicated to battlefield sabotage: the Daidoji Harriers. These covert combat units strike at unprotected supply lines or demolish infrastructure such as bridges, food, or shelter to keep the enemy at bay. Generally deployed amidst larger formations of infantry to disguise their actions, these agents are extremely skilled at tactics that render the greatest impact with the fewest losses on their own side. Dragon Clan. The Dragon Clan’s activities are already shrouded in mystery to the other Great Clans much of the time. While the Dragon Clan has no formal organization for its covert agents, none of its traditions are especially averse to using cover tactics either. From Mirumoto infantry who skirmish using guerilla tactics in the high mountains to Kitsuki-trained magistrates who go undercover in criminal organizations to members of the Togashi Order who travel the land incognito, there are more than a few individuals within the Dragon Clan who know a bit about the shadowy arts of ninjutsu. Lion Clan. The Ikoma family is famous for its bards who sing the glories of history to inspire future generations. But the Ikoma family also knows the importance of unspoken history: thus, a rare few of its bards are also trained in the Ikoma Shadow tradition. While they seem like normal historians and storytellers to outsiders, they are skilled in infiltration, social manipulation, and espionage. For while Akodo is famous for the virtues he espoused, he also understood the importance of surprise in battle, and the Ikoma family has come to embrace this duality. Phoenix Clan. The Phoenix Clan’s covert operatives tend to be individuals rather than members of any continuous tradition. The Shiba family’s code of selfless service to the Isawa means sometimes undertaking tasks that are unpleasant, and so some members of the Shiba family train in skills that help them achieve this goal. Additionally, the Asako family’s scholars include some of the most skillful hunters of heretical sorcerers, and when these agents take to the field, they usually do so via covert means, using any advantage they can to defeat their terrifyingly powerful foes. Scorpion Clan. The Scorpion Clan’s use of covert operatives and unchivalrous tactics is well-known within the Great Clans, but that does not mean that every single member of the Scorpion Clan is trained in these arts. In fact, most members of the Scorpion Clan are bushi, functionaries, bureaucrats, and administrators, much as in any other clan. The Shosuro family in particular is known for its skilled infiltrators and poisoners. The pervasive whisper that any given person might be a covert Scorpion Clan agent does far more work to keep the other Great Clans in check than the actions of individual shinobi ever could. Unicorn Clan. The Unicorn Clan’s superb scouts are well-versed in many skills that can be put to tenebrous use if desired. Tracking, trap-setting, the knowledge of medicines and poisons: all these things are vital to survival in the wilds, and equally vital to a covert agent. Shadowy Missions The Great Clans of Rokugan do not have a monopoly on covert activity, of course. Several of the Minor Clans have their own undercover agents, such as the Speardancers of the Deer Clan and the legendary thieves of the Cat Clan. Criminal organizations in cities often employ individuals skilled in what could be termed shinobi arts, and hunters in the wild places of Rokugan must often learn these skills simply to survive. Additionally, some shinobi are mercenaries, fighting not for the ideal of loyalty but for coin or some personal ideal or motive. Quick Builds Make Dexterity your highest ability score. Depending on the archetype you choose, Intelligence (Saboteur archetype) or Charisma (Infiltrator archetype) is also valuable. Make Constitution a tertiary ability score, as shinobi risk being caught in difficult situations in which endurance is required. A number of iconic shinobi of Rokugan can be found in the more detailed quick builds provided in the Backgrounds section, such as the Hiruma Skirmisher and Bayushi Manipulator.

(a) 10 shuriken or (b) 4 daggers. concealed armor. unremarkable garb. (a) disguise kit or (b) infiltrator’s equipment. Merciless Strikes You have mastered the art of attacking impaired foes. When you make a melee attack against a creature that is suffering from one or more negative conditions, you can deal 1d4 additional damage per negative condition that creature is suffering, to a maximum of 2d4 additional damage. You can use this feature multiple times per turn, but can’t apply it to the same creature more than once per turn. The amount of additional damage per condition and the maximum additional damage increases as you gain levels in this class as shown in the Merciless Strikes column of the Shinobi table. Ninjutsu You are trained in the art of ninjutsu, using cunning tactics, devious devices, and stealth to achieve your ends. Dexterity is your ninjutsu ability score, which you use for both your shinobi abilities and your ninja tools. You use your Dexterity whenever a ninja tool or shinobi feature refers to your ninjutsu ability. Ninja Tools. Further, you can prepare and use a number of ninja tools, which are weapons and devices to help in your clandestine activities. At 1st level, you can have a maximum of two prepared ninja tools, and this number increases with level as shown in the Shinobi table. After you use a ninja tool, it is expended. As part of a long rest, you can prepare new ninja tools as long as you are not restrained during that time. A list of ninja tools can be found at the end of this section. You are familiar with all of these ninja tools, and can select any of them when deciding which ninja tools to prepare. Ninjutsu Attack Modifier. Some of your ninja tools and shinobi features call for you to make an attack roll against the target. Your attack bonus for these effects is calculated as follows: Ninjutsu attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier Ninjutsu Saving Throws. Some of your ninja tools and shinobi features call for your target to make a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Ninjutsu save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier Expert Prowler Climbing no longer costs additional movement; additionally, you can run and traverse rooftops silently. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when you are at least 10 feet above or below all creatures you are trying to hide from. Nimble Starting at 2nd level, you learn how to slip past foes, confusing them in the process. Once per turn when you leave a hostile creature’s reach, you can spend 15 feet of movement to slip away. When you do, you force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On failure, the creature suffers the disoriented condition (it can’t make opportunity attacks) until the end of your next turn. Shinobi Archetype When you reach 3rd level, you begin to specialize in advanced shinobi tricks and tactics. Choose a shinobi archetype: Infiltrator or Saboteur. The Infiltrator archetype and Saboteur archetype are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Quick Hands Starting at 5th level, your expert sense of timing allows you to weave in ranged attacks and techniques during even the briefest moments of calm. If there are no hostile creatures within 5 feet of you, you can use your bonus action to throw a weapon or use a ninja tool. Escape Artist Starting at 6th level, you are difficult to pin down. You have advantage against grappling checks. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to resist effects that would incapacitate, restrain, or reduce your speed. Finally, your walking speed is increased by 10 feet. Crescent Slash Starting at 7th level, you become adroit at striking multiple foes with a single fell swoop. You can spend your action to make a multitarget attack against each creature in a 5-foot-sweep around you. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. At 15th level, you can use this feature an additional time between rests. Vigilant Mind Starting at 11th level, you are in a constant state of alertness. Increase your passive Perception score by +5, and you cannot be surprised. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern killing intent in a creature you are observing. V enom-Tested Constitution Starting at 14th level, your familiarity and exposure to toxins, poisons, powders, and intense physical conditioning has granted you proficiency in Constitution saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Medicine) checks to treat poison. Deathmark At 17th level, when you deal damage to a creature with a ranged attack, a ninja tool, or a contingency plan, that creature suffers the marked for death condition (your next successful melee attack against it deals an additional 1d8 force damage) for 1 minute. D efy Death At 20th level, when you would take damage that would reduce you to 8 hit points or less, you can spend your reaction to reduce the damage you suffer to 0. Then you can immediately move up to your movement speed in a direction away from the damage source. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity as part of this movement. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you have finished a long rest. Shinobi Archetypes As deniable assets, there are many different means available to shinobi that many samurai see as nefarious: deception, blackmail, and assassination, to name a few. You can pursue these as an Infiltrator, specializing in subterfuge and clandestine operations, or as a Saboteur, focusing your skills on traps and cunning snares. Infiltrator Saboteur N inja Tools The following ninja tools are available to shinobi. A shinobi has access to all of the following tools and can prepare a number of them as part of a long rest as listed in Table 2–4: The Shinobi .

You have a limited number of plans at your disposal. The total number is: Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) + 1/2½ Hero Level (rounded down) Select a set of plans equal to the total above from the plans list. As your maximum number of plans grows, due to your intelligence or level, you can select additional plans for your list. These selections are semi-permanent. When you gain a level, you can decide to exchange one you know for one you don’t. You can enact any plan you know by spending 1 Genius. The Smart Hero table shows how much Genius you have based on your level. Genius recharges when you finish a long rest. Provided you have Genius, you can use any of your plans without restriction. The effect of each plan, as well as the action you must take to enact it, is included in the plan’s individual description. If a plan calls for a saving throw, the save DC is always 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. This is called your “plan DC.” Many plans grow in power as you gain more levels. Each plan describes how it improves, and these enhancements are cumulative unless otherwise noted. Note that heroes multiclassing into Smart Hero have a cap on the level of effect they can access. In Everyday Heroes core rules, each type of hero has their own set of plans as well as shared plans. For the quickstart guide, we offer a smaller mix of the Mastermind and Smart hero plans. Know-It-All . Granted at level 1 . You have advantage on all ability checks to recall information. You’re Doing It Wrong. Granted at level 1 . When an ally that can see and hear you misses with an attack, you can use your reaction to instruct them on the proper technique, allowing them to re-roll the attack. Mental Refresh. Granted at level 2 . When you take a short rest, you can refresh your mind with a nice snack, a power nap, and/or some light reading. You regain 1 Genius point when you finish that rest. You can do this only once before you finish a long rest. Mind over Matter. Granted at level 2. You can treat Constitution saves as Intelligence saves. The Plans Expect the Unexpected When you enact this plan as an action, you prepare yourself for every form of attack. Until you finish a short or long rest, you can use +3 as your defense bonus when calculating your Defense. Plan Enhancements: At 5 th Level: The bonus becomes + 4 . While this plan is active, you can add this bonus to any Strength or Dexterity saving throw you make. I Had It Poisoned Thanks to your brilliant foresight and schemes, this plan can be enacted as a reaction when one of the following occurs: When you or an ally you can see makes a successful attack with a weapon that does piercing or slashing damage to a target. After someone in the same room as you eats something, drinks something, or is given medical treatment. When you enact this plan, choose one of the following poisons. Common Snake Venom. The target must make a Constitution saving throw , suffering 3 d 6 poison damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. Plan Enhancements: At 3 rd Level: You can choose one of the following poisons instead: Rare Hallucinogens . The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be Blinded for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. At 5 th Level: You can choose one of the following poisons instead: Rare Snake Venom. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, suffering 6 d 6 poison damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. I Have The Perfect Disguise When you enact this plan as an action, you can reveal a disguise you have prepared for the occasion. This disguise makes you look almost identical to another person you have seen. The disguise can include facial prosthetics, a realistic wig, skin tone adjustments, and anything else required to mimic the chosen person. It can include any normal clothing or uniform, but any identification or badge does not hold up to more than cursory scrutiny. You can make yourself appear up to 3 inches taller or shorter, and up to 25% lighter or heavier, but this does not hold up to any measurements. The disguise is purely visual; you can’t change your voice. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to pretend to be the person you are disguised as, as long as the target can see you. To discern that the disguise is fake, someone must use their action to inspect your appearance and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your plan DC. If they succeed, they see through the disguise. If they fail, they cannot try again for this disguise. The disguise lasts for 1 hour before pieces begin falling off and breaking apart, at which point it no longer functions. Plan Enhancements: At 3rd Level : You can add a voice modulator to your disguise, allowing you to mimic the chosen person’s voice. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to pretend to be the person you are disguised as if the target can hear or see you. In addition, the disguise can make you appear to be up to 1 foot taller or shorter, and up to 50 % lighter or heavier, which holds up to basic measurements, but not medical exams. At 5 th Level: You can target up to 2 allies within 30 feet of you instead of yourself, or yourself and one ally within 30 feet, giving a unique disguise to each. I Lured You Into Danger You can enact this plan as a reaction when an enemy moves closer to you, within 30 feet, causing the enemy to stumble into a cleaning cart, trip over a mop, get their foot stuck in a loose floorboard, etc. That enemy must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In addition, on a failed save, the target falls prone, and its movement speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its turn, ending its movement. Plan Enhancements: At 3 rd Level: The damage becomes 3 d 6 . At 5 th Level: The damage becomes 5 d 6 . Perfect Position When you enact this plan as a bonus action, you and each ally that can see or hear you can immediately move up to their movement speed. Opportunity attacks made in reaction to this movement are made at disadvantage. Plan Enhancements: At 5 th Level: Each affected hero can move up to their movement speed as a bonus action during each of their turns for the next minute. Opportunity attacks made in reaction to this movement are made at disadvantage. The Right Tool When you enact this plan as an object interaction, you produce the perfect tool for the task at hand; you either brought it with you, had it brought to you, or knew just where to find it. The tool can be any piece of equipment that you can carry and afford. If it is a weapon, it is fully loaded. Plan Enhancements: At 3 rd Level: You can produce up to 2 pieces of equipment. At 5 th Level: You can produce up to 3 pieces of equipment. Slippery Surface When you enact this plan as an action, you slick a 10-foot square surface within 60 feet with oil, ice, marbles, or some other slippery substance. The area becomes difficult terrain. Each combatant standing in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A combatant that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. This effect lasts for 1 minute. Plan Enhancements: At 5 th Level: You can increase the area to a 20 -foot square. Your allies are not affected by the surface thanks to what you did to their shoes. They’ll Never See Us Coming When you enact this plan as an action, you and any allies you choose that can see or hear you all gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Affected heroes leave no tracks or other trace of their movement. This effect lasts for 10 minutes, or until you enact this plan again. Plan Enhancements: At 3 rd Level: The bonus becomes + 10 At 5 th Level: The bonus lasts for 1 hour instead of 10 minutes. When A Plan Comes Together After you enact any other plan, you may activate this plan as a free action. You gain 2d10 temporary hit points due to your supreme confidence. Plan Enhancements: 3 rd: 3 d 10 temporary hit points 5 th: 5 d 10 temporary hit points",

        "description": "Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air. Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning. Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte⁠. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue. Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer. Raw Magic Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways. The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconi⁠c bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the orig⁠in of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power. Unexplained Powers Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on. Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origi⁠n. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know. Creating a Sorcerer The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origi⁠n of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origi⁠n that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well? How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power. Quick Build You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light , prestidigitation , ray of frost , and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and magic missile .

This font of magic, whatever its origi⁠n, fuels your spells. See \"Casting a Spell\" for the general rules of spellcasting and \"Sorcerer Spells by Level\" for the sorcerer spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantr⁠ips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantri⁠ps Known column of the Sorcerer table. Spell Slots The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended sp⁠ell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands⁠ using either slot. Spells⁠ Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spell⁠s of your choice. Each of these spell⁠s must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcastin⁠g ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when settin⁠g the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting⁠ Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. Sorcerous Origin⁠ Choose a sorcerous origi⁠n, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. Font of Magic At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. Sorcery Points You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest. Flexible Casting You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spe⁠ll slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Creating Spell S⁠lots. You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spe⁠ll slots no higher in level than 5th. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest. Creating Spell Slots Spell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost 1st 2 2nd 3 3rd 5 4th 6 5th 7 Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level. Metamagic At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. Careful Spell When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. Distant Spell When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. Empowered Spell When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Extended Spell When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. Heightened Spell When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. Quickened Spell When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the ca⁠sting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. Subtle Spell When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. Twinned Spell When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Sorcerous Restoration At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. Sorcerous Origins Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.

Sorcerous Origins Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic, such as a draconic bloodline. Draconic Bloodline Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. Dragon Ancestor At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. You can speak, read, and write Draconic . Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. Table: Draconic Ancestry Dragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold Draconic Resilience As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Elemental Affinity Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. Dragon Wings At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. Draconic Presence Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.",

        "description": "A Dazzling Mage Filled with Innate Magic Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations. Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source. Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells , which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light , Prestidigitation , Shocking Grasp , and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table. Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells . Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer , your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells . Level 1: Innate Sorcery An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action , you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits: The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1. You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast. You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest . Level 2: Font of Magic You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest . You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points. Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required). Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action , you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest . Creating Spell Slots Spell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost Min. Sorcerer Level 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 5 4 6 7 5 7 9 Level 2: Metamagic Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “ Meta­magic Options ” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17. Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery , Clockwork Sorcery , Draconic Sorcery , and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration When you finish a Short Rest , you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it. In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended. Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it. Metamagic Options The following options are available to your Meta­magic feature . The options are presented in alphabetical order. Careful Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature ). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save. Distant Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet. Empowered Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Extended Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires Concentration , you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration . Heightened Spell Cost: 2 Sorcery Points When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell. Quickened Spell Cost: 2 Sorcery Points When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way. Seeking Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Subtle Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell. Transmuted Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid , Cold , Fire , Lightning , Poison , Thunder . Twinned Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person , that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature , you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell’s effective level by 1. Sorcerer Spell List This section presents the Sorcerer spell list . The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations. Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source. Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. Light , Prestidigitation , Shocking Grasp , and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice. When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table. Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination. If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells. Level 1: Innate Sorcery An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits: The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1. You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast. You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest. Level 2: Font of Magic You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest. You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points. Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required). Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest. Creating Spell Slots Spell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost Min. Sorcerer Level 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 5 4 6 7 5 7 9 Level 2: Metamagic Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “Meta­magic Options” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17. Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Sorcery, Clockwork Sorcery, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it. In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended. Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it. Metamagic Options The following options are available to your Meta­magic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order. Careful Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save. Distant Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet. Empowered Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Extended Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration. Heightened Spell Cost: 2 Sorcery Points When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell. Quickened Spell Cost: 2 Sorcery Points When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way. Seeking Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Subtle Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell. Transmuted Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder. Twinned Spell Cost: 1 Sorcery Point When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person , that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell’s effective level by 1. Sorcerer Spell List This section presents the Sorcerer spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

        "description": "A dendus hurls a stream of sharp blades into his enemies before disappearing in the shifting light, only to emerge again in from the shadows in the distance. A lunar eldori rewires the security panel, deactivating the laser sensor grid before signaling to her companions to move into the hallway. The holographic disguise fades away from the crescent promethean, revealing his true identity to the stunned agents who so freely revealed all their secrets. Even in the shining jewel of the Sorium Accord, or the peaceful worlds of the Core, shadows exist. If left unchecked, they spread like an invisible web of darkness, vying for power while the rest of society remains unaware. Specialists work their craft between the judicial societies of the Core, and the shadows of the galactic underworld. A specialist relies on their adept skill and instincts to overcome obstacles. They have a wealth of expertise, from figuring out the weak points of any adversary to being able to find their way through the trickiest of tight spots. They can be found working their craft anywhere from running goods between seedy smuggling dens to being a secret agent in defense of their government. Quick and Precise Rather than focusing on brawn, specialists fight using speed, skill, and precision to dispatch their foes. They often use small, easily concealed weapons and implant-controlled gadgets that allow them to take advantage of their enemy’s weaknesses. Their style of practice, however, varies greatly. Each specialist has a chosen range of expertise within which they hone their skills. Some rely on subterfuge and stealth to infiltrate secure or hidden places. Some rely on their quick-wit, hacking, and tools of distraction to catch their targets off guard. Professional Courtesies Often finding themselves in dangerous situations, an experienced specialist knows survival sometimes hinges on the right information and a reliable ally. Whether they are smugglers, investigators, space jockeys, or assassins, specialists often keep a small network of contacts and allies who they can trust even in the worst of situations. As espers, specialists are aware that sometimes the best information can come from other specialists, even if their profession would be considered unsavory toward their own. With this in mind, many of them communicate secretly over the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix, using coded language only they can decipher. This often comes with a simple, yet courteous, “don’t ask, don’t tell” agreement when it comes to identity and sharing of information. Creating a Specialist Specialists have a very broad range of available skills or techniques. When you are creating your character, consider your desired profession as well as on which side of the law your character stands. How did your character fall into their practice? Are you part of an organization? When did your innate skills manifest? (see the “Natural Aptitude” class feature below) Do you use your powers for money or do you fight for an ideal or cause? Ability Scores Dexterity should be your primary ability score. Depending on the type of specialist you wish to create, you should choose either Intelligence or Charisma as your second highest ability score, followed by Wisdom.

Hit Points Hit Dice : 1d8 per specialist level Hit Points at 1st Level : 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per specialist level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, autopistol, longblade, shortblade, sabre Tools: Infiltration Tools Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence Skills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Computers, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a sabre or (b) a light pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition (a) a light pistol with 15 rounds of ammunition or (b) a shortblade (a) an agent’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack (a) Armor Jacket, two combat knives, and infiltration tools Natural Aptitude As an esper, you have a natural affinity for particular skills. These innate skill competences come instinctively to you. They could have manifested at anytime during your lifetime, often marked with a specific visual effect. At 1st level, choose two skills in which you are proficient, or one of those skills and one tool proficiency in which you are proficient (including vehicles). Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with tools or vehicles) to gain this benefit. Optional Rule: Esper Effect You may choose a particular effect that manifests whenever you use a skill in which you have a natural aptitude. The effect reflects your esper link with the Crucibles and may be visual or more intrinsic. Examples could be small trails of wind behind you when using the Acrobatics skill, data trails in your eyes when using Computers, a slight darkening of light around you for Stealth, or an aire of sheer confidence when using Persuasion. Whatever effect you choose must be limited to your character’s space and must also be approved by your GM. Deft Strike Beginning at 1st level, you know how to exploit a foe’s weakness to make a quick, powerful strike. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. Shadownet ID Your training and expertise have earned you an online avatar on the Shadownet – a secret underworld of locations and networks within the Silrayne Intergalactic Matrix (SIM). These secret messages and locations can only be accessed or decoded with a personal set of codes and your Shadownet ID (which may also require a partial genetic ID as well). Members of the Shadownet can converse in private, trade or share secrets, acquire locations for black market goods and resources, and look up information about different territories and the secret societies that may operate in those areas. Cunning Action Starting at 2nd level, your superior reaction and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. Specialist Archetype At 3rd level, you may choose an archetype that represents your chosen form of expertise and your path toward improvement. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature Uncanny Dodge Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you. Evasion Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as the gravity well talent or a drone’s blast pattern ability. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Reliable Talent By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. Blindsense Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. Slippery Mind By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Elusive Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated. Stroke of Luck At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Specialist Archetypes Though specialists are trained with many similar basic traits, very rarely are any of them cut from the same cloth. Your archetype represents the path upon which you’ve chosen to focus your training as a specialist, as well as the style in which you operate. Infiltrator Investigator Operative Artifice",

The captain laughs, thinking the orc easy prey, failing to notice the orc’s command as an unseen tiefling slams her greataxe into the captain’s back. A gnome, protected within a ring of allies, furrows her brow as thousands of possibilities race through her mind. In a matter of seconds, she finds the perfect answer and calls out the offensive to her allies, leading to a quick and decisive victory. A dragonborn stares calmly into the face of a beholder, unflinching as all eleven eyes stare down upon them. With only their analysis and a single dagger at their disposal, the dragonborn ducks under the first of the beholder’s rays and plunges their dagger into the aberration’s central eye, before commanding their allies to attack. Masters of the mind and the battlefield, a tactician embodies the idea that one does not need incredible strength or arcane might to achieve greatness, only a sharp wit and an analytical mind. With no magical prowess to speak of and scant more martial skills, I had mistakenly assumed that tacticians were not cut out for adventuring. However, their awesome intellects make them capable leaders, master planners, and deadly foes... - Drizzt Resourceful Thinkers Blessed with neither magical powers nor physical greatness, at first glance many would assume that tacticians have a difficult time making do. Looks can be deceiving and this underestimation is what allows the tactician to thrive. The power of a tactician’s mind is a frightening thing, overflowing with potential and focus that benefits anyone that stands by their side. Whether it’s to lead an army to victory or direct a small strike team, tacticians find themselves seeking knowledge wherever it may be found. Uncommon Minds Intelligence, nerve, and communication are the three pillars of a tactician. This makes them unique, as their intelligence directs them away from the traditional path of magical studies and towards the mastery of combat maneuvers. These natural born leaders often find themselves pursuing a life of adventure in which they can push themselves to the limits and truly test their mental abilities. Creating a Tactician Creating a tactician begins by deciding the origin of your character’s genius. Are they a natural born savant who has always risen above their peers, or is their brilliance a result of hard work and perseverance? Did you have a kindly teacher who helped foster your brilliance, or is your intelligence the result of independent study and the harsh lessons of life? Second, ask yourself why your character chose to become a tactician over other pursuits. Do they distrust magic, did they lack the aptitude for it, or did they simply never consider or receive the opportunity to study it? Furthermore, did they feel that devoting their skills to physical greatness distracted them from exercising the full extent of their tactical techniques? Finally, why did your character choose a life of adventure? Most tacticians, with their brilliance and cunning, are more than capable of earning a comfortable living as merchants, royal advisors, or battlefield strategists. Therefore, why choose a life of travel, danger, and uncertainty, particularly when your character lacks the common powers of strength or magic to defend themselves? Perhaps for those very reasons your tactician chose to hone their minds in the fires of adventure, rather than in a comfortable and safe vocation. Perhaps they have a vendetta and are traveling seeking revenge. Or perhaps they simply wish to acquire more knowledge or wealth. Regardless, your character clearly knows that they will prevail with their keen analytic senses and reliable leadership skills. Quick Build You can make a tactician quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your primary ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the sage or soldier background. Class Features Hit Points Hit Dice : 1d8 per tactician level Hit Points at 1st Level : 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels : 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per tactician level after 1st Proficiencies Armor : Light armor Weapons : Simple weapons, hand crossbow, longsword, rapier Tools : Any two of your choice Saving Throws : Intelligence, Wisdom Skills : Choose three from History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Persuasion, or Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your backstory: (a) a longsword or (b) a rapier (a) a hand crossbow and quiver of 20 bolts, or (b) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows (a) a diplomat’s pack, (b) an explorer’s pack, or (c) a scholar’s pack Leather armor, a dagger, and one set of tools that you are proficient in Alternatively, you may start with 4d4 × 10 gp to buy your own equipment. Perfect Plan Beginning at 1st level, you become a master at devising the best course of action for the future. When you complete a long rest, you gain a number of Perfect Plan dice, as shown in the Perfect Plan Dice column of the Tactician table, which are d4s. Upon receiving these dice, you can spend 10 minutes concocting a plan that includes a number of willing creatures up to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2 creatures). Whenever a creature that is a part of your Perfect Plan and that can see or hear you makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction to expend one of your Perfect Plan dice, adding the roll to the result. You can wait until after the d20 is rolled before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once a Perfect Plan die is rolled, it is lost, and only one Perfect Plan die may be used at a time. You regain all expended Perfect Plan dice when you complete a long rest. When you reach 7th level, you can add your Perfect Plan dice to saving throws in the same way you would to a creature’s attack rolls or ability checks.

You can use your Intelligence instead of your Dexterity when determining your Armor Class. Polyglot Also at 1st level, your mind grasps more information than the average person. You learn two languages of your choice. Analyze At 2nd level, you gain the ability to focus your intellectual prowess into breaking down the defenses of your opponent and utilizing the information gained to your advantage. As a bonus action, you can begin analyzing a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. Your analysis lasts for 1 minute and provides a number of benefits as shown below, as well as additional benefits as you gain levels in this class. Your analysis ends early if you are incapacitated, you end your turn unable to see the creature, you begin analyzing a different creature, or you die. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses whenever you complete a short or long rest. Combat Analysis For as long as you are analyzing a creature and can see that creature, you gain the following benefits: When you hit a creature that you are analyzing with an attack, you can expend a Perfect Plan die. Alternately, when an allied creature that is part of your Perfect Plan hits a creature you are analyzing with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend a Perfect Plan die. If you do, the attack deals additional damage. Roll 1d4 and add the result to the attack’s damage. If you are 6th level, add 2d4 instead. If you are 11th level, add 3d4 instead, and if you are 17th level, add 4d4 instead. Creatures you are analyzing have disadvantage on opportunity attacks made against you. Trait Analysis At the end of each of your turns, if you are analyzing a creature and can see that creature, it must make an Intelligence saving throw against your analysis save DC. On a failure, you learn one of the following characteristics about the target: Armor class Any two of its ability scores that you choose Damage vulnerabilities Damage resistances Damage immunities Condition immunities Analysis Ability You use your Intelligence to closely evaluate your foes in combat. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw for a tactician feature. Analysis save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Contingency Plan Also at 2nd level, with a little time to rest and think, you can adjust your plans to new situations. Whenever you complete a short rest, you can choose to regain a number of expended Perfect Plan dice equal to 1 + half your maximum. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest. When you reach 14th level, you can use this feature any number of times. Strategic Focus At 3rd level, you’ve decided to hone your tactical prowess into a specific long-term Strategic Focus of your choice: Grandmaster, Mentalist, Scholar, or War Mind, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Expertise Also at 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat. Guiding Guile At 5th level, you have wit and direction that others wisely heed. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can call out a command to an allied creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you. That creature can use their reaction to make one weapon attack against the same target. If that ally is part of your Perfect Plan, you can expend and add a Perfect Plan die to their attack roll as a part of the same reaction. Resilient Mind At 7th level, you are naturally able to resist effects that would alter your mind. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Wisdom saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Additionally, you gain advantage on saving throws made against being charmed, frightened, or stunned. Advanced Planning Techniques At 9th level, your plans surpass perfection. When you make your Perfect Plan, you can name a creature or a location as part of your plan, which persists as a part of your plan until a new plan is made. A creature you name must be one you are familiar with or can describe. A location you name must be one you are familiar with or have a map of. The location is a cube up to ten times your tactician level on a side in feet. If you name a creature, you gain one of the following benefits: Whenever you add a Perfect Plan die to an attack made against the named creature, you can choose to reroll the die if the result is a 1 or 2. You must use the new result. Choose an ability score. Whenever the named creature makes a saving throw using that ability score, you use your reaction to expend and roll a Perfect Plan dice, subtracting the result from the target’s roll. You may use this ability before or after the target makes their roll, but before the DM determines the outcome of the roll. Whenever the named creature would be pushed out of the reach of another creature that is a part of your Perfect Plan, you may use your reaction and expend a Perfect Plan dice. When you do, the named creature provokes an opportunity attack from each creature that is a part of your Perfect Plan whose reach it would be pushed out of. If you name a location, you gain one of the following benefits: Whenever you add a Perfect Plan die to an attack made within the named location, you can choose to reroll the die if the result is a 1 or 2. You must use the new result. Whenever you add a Perfect Plan die to an ability check or saving throw made by a creature in the named location, you can choose to reroll the die if the result is a 1 or 2. You must use the new result. As a bonus action, you can spend one of your Perfect Plan dice to allow each creature within the named location that can see or hear you to use their reaction and move up to half their speed. When you reach 17th level, you can name both a creature and a location as a part of making your Perfect Plan. Mind’s Eye Beginning at 9th level, you are able to keep track of the world around you, even when you cannot see it. Other creatures can’t gain advantage on attack rolls made against you as a result of you being unable to see them. Analytic Advantage Starting at 11th level, your analysis allows your allies to inhibit your foes more readily. Whenever you add a Perfect Plan die to the damage roll of an attack, the target of that attack suffers one of the following penalties: It can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. It is pushed back up to 10 feet away from its attacker. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your analysis save DC or fall prone. Improvised Plan When you reach 13th level, you can quickly cobble together a strong plan of action, even in the heat of the moment. As an action on your turn, or whenever you roll initiative, you may expend a Perfect Plan dice and call out an impromptu plan to a number of creatures that can hear you, up to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2). Each of those creatures gains an Improvisation die, which is a d4. Once within the next minute, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Improvisation die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Improvisation die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Improvisation die at a time. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses whenever you complete a long rest. Battlefield Commander When you reach 14th level, you can effortlessly call out commands in the heat of battle. In combat, you get a special extra reaction. You can use this special reaction only to utilize your Perfect Plan dice, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction. Piercing Eye By 17th level, you are always one step ahead of your enemies, able to predict their every move and capitalize on their every weakness. The first time you make an attack roll against a creature you are analyzing on each of your turns, you may add a Perfect Plan dice to your attack without using your reaction or expending the die. Ultimate Knowing At 20th level, your knowledge in tactics and planning is unparalleled, almost supernatural. Your Intelligence increases by 2. Your maximum score is now 22. Additionally, your keen sense of strategy and anticipation of adversity grants you the following benefits: You cannot be surprised. You have advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Strategic Focus All tacticians are brilliant, but not all tacticians agree on the same way to harness and pursue their genius. Thus, tacticians will choose or gravitate towards a specific Strategic Focus, a particular method of honing one’s skills. By 3rd level, a tactician chooses a Strategic Focus in which to invest their talents. Grandmaster Mentalist Scholar War Mind Multiclassing Ability Score Minimum. Intelligence 13. Proficiencies Gained. Light armor, simple weapons, one tool of your choice.",

You have advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Strategic Focus All tacticians are brilliant, but not all tacticians agree on the same way to harness and pursue their genius. Thus, tacticians will choose or gravitate towards a specific Strategic Focus, a particular method of honing one’s skills.

        "description": "Flourishing a gilded skull snatched from within the folds of a cloak, a dwarf summons a fierce-eyed angel in a flare of blinding radiance, emphatically encouraging it to fantastical feats of fury. Beaming from ear to ear, a chemical-stained gnome admires her handiwork amongst the clutter of her laboratory: a ‘snektopus’; eight venom-fanged maws perfectly spliced with the intelligence of a cephalopod. Coughing in the smoking ruins of the cultists’ former hideout, a tiefling gives their fire-infused owlbear a playful rub behind the ears, contemplating a job well done and the rewards to be claimed. Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the ‘very tiny stitches’ of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem. Creating a Tamer What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch ‘em all? The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other’s innermost thoughts. However, such bondsdiffer between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience. Quick Build You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

Optional Rule: Multiclassing If using the optional rule on multiclassing, use the following prerequisites, proficiencies, and spell slots if you choose the tamer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum: As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you’re already a tamer. The ability you use to qualify to multiclass into tamer must be your tamer spellcasting ability. Proficiencies Gained. If tamer isn’t your initial class, you gain the following proficiencies when you take your first level as a tamer: light armour, shields, simple weapons, and nets. Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the tamer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. Pocket Familiar 1st-level Tamer feature You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies. Vessel . When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel. If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion. Home Planes Some magical effects, like the banishment spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel. Summoning . As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time. Dominated Companions A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the dominate monster spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC . On a failed saving throw, it is recalled, while on a success, it is not. Combat. In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to. Rest . A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points. Items. Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type. Item Bonding . Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement.) Companion Barding . You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape. Companion Barding Cost Size Humanoid Shape Cost Abstract Shape Cost Tiny 0.5x 1x Small 1x 2x Medium 1x 2x Large 2x 4x Huge 4x 8x Soul Bond 1st-level Tamer feature Companions make death saving throws, die, and can be revived like any player character. A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest. Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain half their maximum hit points. You have a pool of healing power equal to five times your tamer level that replenishes when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to draw power from that pool, restoring a total number of hit points amongst your companions up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Monster Trainer 1st-level Tamer feature As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DC s. Training. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these. Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer. Companion Improvement Training Table Improvement Effect Speed Training Increase one existing speed by 15 feet up to a maximum of 150% of the creature’s base speed, rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment*. Toughen Up Your companion gains an additional Hit Die, increasing its hit point maximum. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Ability Boost Increase one of your companion's ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20. Go For the Throat Your companion gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls made with its natural weapons or unarmed strikes**. Survival Instincts Your companion gains proficiency in one saving throw. War Training Your companion gains proficiency with one armour type or two weapons***. *E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet. **Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons. ***Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.

This is indicated by the value ‘6/1’ in the ‘CR 1’ column and the level ‘10’ row. Tame Creature 1st-level Tamer feature One way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table. Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR. Vessels and Cost At 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process. You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature. Taming a Creature . As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if: It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm. It is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce ). It has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table). It has a higher CR than the vessel can capture. It has more than half of its hit points. If a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest. Lost Traits . When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block: The ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond). Any summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction). The Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits. Any legendary actions and legendary action options. Any lair actions and regional effects. Any mythic traits and mythic action options. Optional Rule: Non-Combat Taming If a player impresses a celestial with an especially noble act, or rears a creature from an egg, that creature might be willing to become a tamer’s companion. If so, feel free to ignore the usual rules regarding saving throws on taming, and let the beautiful story of companionship unfold! Abilities and Proficiency As your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modifiers, saving throws, attack modifiers, and saving throw DC s will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work. First you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, s ubtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DC s. For save DC s, subtract an additional 8 from the DC . Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers. Let’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC ), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution ( DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modifier). If the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively. Spellcasting 2nd-level Tamer feature By 2nd level, you have learned to harness your mental fortitude to augment the potential of others. You can cast tamer spells. Cantrips At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the tamer spell list. You learn additional tamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tamer table. Spell Slots The Tamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tamer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tamer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Tamer table shows when you learn more tamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability When you gain your first level in this class, choose whether you use your knowledge (Intelligence), willpower (Wisdom), or force of personality (Charisma) as your spellcasting ability for your tamer spells. You use this spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a creature’s vessel as a spellcasting focus for your tamer spells. Powerful Companion Abilities Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is different, and some might not require changing. Recharge Abilities. Some creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following: Recharge Condition Companion Recharge Recharge (4-6) Recharges after 1 minute Recharge (5-6) Recharges after 10 minutes Recharge (6) Recharges on a short or long rest Perpetually Active Abilities. Some traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours ”. Work with your GM to find a balanced solution for your game. Bolster 2nd-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you and you are holding its vessel, or if you are holding its vessel with it inside, you can use an action to expend one spell slot to restore hit points to your companion equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1) plus an additional 2d4 per level of the spell slot expended. Psychic Bond 2nd-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your companion’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the companion has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. Spell Swap. While your companion is summoned, is within 100 feet of you, and you hold its vessel, any spells your companion knows are added to your known spells. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range of self or touch, your companion can be the target of that spell. Pocket Family 3rd-level Tamer feature As you gain levels in this class, the number of companions and maximum size of companion to which you can become bonded increases. You can be bonded to two, three, four, five, or six creatures at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, respectively. Your companions can be sized Medium at 5th level, Large at 11th level, and Huge at 17th level. If you are already bonded to your maximum number of companions and become bonded to a new companion, you must choose one existing companion to release from its vessel. When you bond with a new companion, the companion gains improvements and Hit Dice based on its CR and your tamer level. See the Tamer Companion Summary table for details. Training Paradigm 3rd-level Tamer feature You choose the type of Training Paradigm you follow from the list of available paradigms, which are detailed after the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level. At 18th level, the 7th-level feature is improved. Ability Score Improvement 4th-level Tamer feature When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Multiattack 5th-level Tamer feature Through rigorous training, you can access the innate fury of your companions. When you take a bonus action or action to command your companion, you can command it to use its Multiattack action, if it has one. Malleable Presence 5th-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour towards one creature you can see as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the aggressive or cautious behaviours. At the start of each of the target creature’s turns for the next minute , it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your tamer spell save DC if it is within 30 feet of your companion and can see your companion. On a failure, it suffers the effects of the associated behaviour until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is unaffected. Aggressive. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion. Cautious. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 5 feet of the attacker. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Alpha Strike 6th-level Tamer feature While summoning a companion, your psychic connection is at its closest, allowing you to quickly relay your intent. As part of the action to summon a companion, you can command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action, which it does so on its turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest. Wilful Blows 6th-level Tamer feature Your magical potency is channeled through your companions’ strikes. Your companions’ attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Switcheroo 13th-level Tamer feature You learn how to switch places with your companion in the nick of time. While you and your companion are within 100 feet of each other, you can use a bonus action, or a reaction when you or your companion is the target of an attack by an attacker you can see, to magically switch places with your companion. If performed as a reaction, the creature that appears in the targeted creature’s space becomes the new target of the attack. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Magnificent Presence 17th-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the provoking poise or shrinking violet behaviours. Provoking Poise . For the next minute , your companion draws the attention of nearby creatures. While within 15 feet of your companion, any creature that is hostile towards your companion and that can see it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion. Shrinking Violet. For the next minute , your companion appears small and unassuming, making little noise. Any creature that is hostile towards your companion has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 15 feet of the attacker. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Summon the Horde 20th-level Tamer feature In times of great need, a tamer can summon many of its companions simultaneously. As an action, you can summon additional companions which remain summoned for 1 minute . You can have a maximum of three companions summoned simultaneously as a result of using this feature. As an action on subsequent turns, you can issue mental commands to all your companions at once, allowing them to take an action in their stat block or some other action. You choose the order in which your companions act each round. After the minute elapses, all your companions bar one (which you choose) return to their vessels and a wave of lethargy sweeps over you; you can’t move or take actions until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Tamer Paradigms Leader (cha) Infuser (cha) Necromancer (cha) Splicer (cha)",

        "description": "Flourishing a gilded skull snatched from within the folds of a cloak, a dwarf summons a fierce-eyed angel in a flare of blinding radiance, emphatically encouraging it to fantastical feats of fury. Beaming from ear to ear, a chemical-stained gnome admires her handiwork amongst the clutter of her laboratory: a ‘snektopus’; eight venom-fanged maws perfectly spliced with the intelligence of a cephalopod. Coughing in the smoking ruins of the cultists’ former hideout, a tiefling gives their fire-infused owlbear a playful rub behind the ears, contemplating a job well done and the rewards to be claimed. Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the ‘very tiny stitches’ of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem. Creating a Tamer What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch ‘em all? The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other’s innermost thoughts. However, such bondsdiffer between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience. Quick Build You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

Optional Rule: Multiclassing If using the optional rule on multiclassing, use the following prerequisites, proficiencies, and spell slots if you choose the tamer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum: As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you’re already a tamer. The ability you use to qualify to multiclass into tamer must be your tamer spellcasting ability. Proficiencies Gained. If tamer isn’t your initial class, you gain the following proficiencies when you take your first level as a tamer: light armour, shields, simple weapons, and nets. Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the tamer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. Pocket Familiar 1st-level Tamer feature You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies. Vessel . When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel. If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion. Home Planes Some magical effects, like the banishment spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel. Summoning . As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time. Dominated Companions A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the dominate monster spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC . On a failed saving throw, it is recalled, while on a success, it is not. Combat. In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to. Rest . A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points. Items. Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type. Item Bonding . Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement.) Companion Barding . You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape. Companion Barding Cost Size Humanoid Shape Cost Abstract Shape Cost Tiny 0.5x 1x Small 1x 2x Medium 1x 2x Large 2x 4x Huge 4x 8x Soul Bond 1st-level Tamer feature Companions make death saving throws, die, and can be revived like any player character. A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest. Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain half their maximum hit points. You have a pool of healing power equal to five times your tamer level that replenishes when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to draw power from that pool, restoring a total number of hit points amongst your companions up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Monster Trainer 1st-level Tamer feature As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DC s. Training. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these. Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer. Companion Improvement Training Table Improvement Effect Speed Training Increase one existing speed by 15 feet up to a maximum of 150% of the creature’s base speed, rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment*. Toughen Up Your companion gains an additional Hit Die, increasing its hit point maximum. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Ability Boost Increase one of your companion's ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20. Go For the Throat Your companion gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls made with its natural weapons or unarmed strikes**. Survival Instincts Your companion gains proficiency in one saving throw. War Training Your companion gains proficiency with one armour type or two weapons***. *E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet. **Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons. ***Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.

This is indicated by the value ‘6/1’ in the ‘CR 1’ column and the level ‘10’ row. Tame Creature 1st-level Tamer feature One way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table. Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR. Vessels and Cost At 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process. You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature. Taming a Creature . As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if: It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm. It is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce ). It has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table). It has a higher CR than the vessel can capture. It has more than half of its hit points. If a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest. Lost Traits . When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block: The ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond). Any summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction). The Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits. Any legendary actions and legendary action options. Any lair actions and regional effects. Any mythic traits and mythic action options. Optional Rule: Non-Combat Taming If a player impresses a celestial with an especially noble act, or rears a creature from an egg, that creature might be willing to become a tamer’s companion. If so, feel free to ignore the usual rules regarding saving throws on taming, and let the beautiful story of companionship unfold! Abilities and Proficiency As your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modifiers, saving throws, attack modifiers, and saving throw DC s will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work. First you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, s ubtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DC s. For save DC s, subtract an additional 8 from the DC . Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers. Let’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC ), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution ( DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modifier). If the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively. Spellcasting 2nd-level Tamer feature By 2nd level, you have learned to harness your mental fortitude to augment the potential of others. You can cast tamer spells. Cantrips At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the tamer spell list. You learn additional tamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tamer table. Spell Slots The Tamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tamer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tamer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Tamer table shows when you learn more tamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability When you gain your first level in this class, choose whether you use your knowledge (Intelligence), willpower (Wisdom), or force of personality (Charisma) as your spellcasting ability for your tamer spells. You use this spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a creature’s vessel as a spellcasting focus for your tamer spells. Powerful Companion Abilities Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is different, and some might not require changing. Recharge Abilities. Some creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following: Recharge Condition Companion Recharge Recharge (4-6) Recharges after 1 minute Recharge (5-6) Recharges after 10 minutes Recharge (6) Recharges on a short or long rest Perpetually Active Abilities. Some traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours ”. Work with your GM to find a balanced solution for your game. Bolster 2nd-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you and you are holding its vessel, or if you are holding its vessel with it inside, you can use an action to expend one spell slot to restore hit points to your companion equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1) plus an additional 2d4 per level of the spell slot expended. Psychic Bond 2nd-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your companion’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the companion has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. Spell Swap. While your companion is summoned, is within 100 feet of you, and you hold its vessel, any spells your companion knows are added to your known spells. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range of self or touch, your companion can be the target of that spell. Pocket Family 3rd-level Tamer feature As you gain levels in this class, the number of companions and maximum size of companion to which you can become bonded increases. You can be bonded to two, three, four, five, or six creatures at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, respectively. Your companions can be sized Medium at 5th level, Large at 11th level, and Huge at 17th level. If you are already bonded to your maximum number of companions and become bonded to a new companion, you must choose one existing companion to release from its vessel. When you bond with a new companion, the companion gains improvements and Hit Dice based on its CR and your tamer level. See the Tamer Companion Summary table for details. Training Paradigm 3rd-level Tamer feature You choose the type of Training Paradigm you follow from the list of available paradigms, which are detailed after the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level. At 18th level, the 7th-level feature is improved. Ability Score Improvement 4th-level Tamer feature When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Multiattack 5th-level Tamer feature Through rigorous training, you can access the innate fury of your companions. When you take a bonus action or action to command your companion, you can command it to use its Multiattack action, if it has one. Malleable Presence 5th-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour towards one creature you can see as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the aggressive or cautious behaviours. At the start of each of the target creature’s turns for the next minute , it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your tamer spell save DC if it is within 30 feet of your companion and can see your companion. On a failure, it suffers the effects of the associated behaviour until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is unaffected. Aggressive. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion. Cautious. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 5 feet of the attacker. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Alpha Strike 6th-level Tamer feature While summoning a companion, your psychic connection is at its closest, allowing you to quickly relay your intent. As part of the action to summon a companion, you can command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action, which it does so on its turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest. Wilful Blows 6th-level Tamer feature Your magical potency is channeled through your companions’ strikes. Your companions’ attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Switcheroo 13th-level Tamer feature You learn how to switch places with your companion in the nick of time. While you and your companion are within 100 feet of each other, you can use a bonus action, or a reaction when you or your companion is the target of an attack by an attacker you can see, to magically switch places with your companion. If performed as a reaction, the creature that appears in the targeted creature’s space becomes the new target of the attack. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Magnificent Presence 17th-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the provoking poise or shrinking violet behaviours. Provoking Poise . For the next minute , your companion draws the attention of nearby creatures. While within 15 feet of your companion, any creature that is hostile towards your companion and that can see it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion. Shrinking Violet. For the next minute , your companion appears small and unassuming, making little noise. Any creature that is hostile towards your companion has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 15 feet of the attacker. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Summon the Horde 20th-level Tamer feature In times of great need, a tamer can summon many of its companions simultaneously. As an action, you can summon additional companions which remain summoned for 1 minute . You can have a maximum of three companions summoned simultaneously as a result of using this feature. As an action on subsequent turns, you can issue mental commands to all your companions at once, allowing them to take an action in their stat block or some other action. You choose the order in which your companions act each round. After the minute elapses, all your companions bar one (which you choose) return to their vessels and a wave of lethargy sweeps over you; you can’t move or take actions until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Tamer Paradigms Leader (int) Infuser (int) Necromancer (int) Splicer (int)",

Whether imbuing their companions with the primordial elements, enhancing them through the ‘very tiny stitches’ of biomancy, or inciting them with words of encouragement, tamers work through their captured friends. Alone, a tamer possesses little in the way of destructive ability. With carefully selected companions, a tamer can become an unstoppable menagerie of mayhem. Creating a Tamer What prompted you to begin taming creatures? Loneliness? A need to transport your favourite dragonling through customs? A pathological desire to catch ‘em all? The bond tamers experience with their companions are incredibly intimate; both are privy to the other’s innermost thoughts. However, such bondsdiffer between tamers: where one tamer might view a companion as friend and equal, another might view the creature as a tool with which to fulfill their own goals. Have you lost a companion before? How did you react? Perhaps it was emotionally traumatising, or perhaps it was simply a mere inconvenience. Quick Build You can make a tamer by following this suggestion: Choose Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma to be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

Optional Rule: Multiclassing If using the optional rule on multiclassing, use the following prerequisites, proficiencies, and spell slots if you choose the tamer as one of your classes. Ability Score Minimum: As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you’re already a tamer. The ability you use to qualify to multiclass into tamer must be your tamer spellcasting ability. Proficiencies Gained. If tamer isn’t your initial class, you gain the following proficiencies when you take your first level as a tamer: light armour, shields, simple weapons, and nets. Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded down) in the tamer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots. Pocket Familiar 1st-level Tamer feature You become bonded to a companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn’t a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can’t cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies. Vessel . When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejewelled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exists in stasis; it doesn’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralised. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilised when it enters its vessel. If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer’s companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion. Home Planes Some magical effects, like the banishment spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel. Summoning . As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, or any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You can dismiss a companion within 30 feet of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time. Dominated Companions A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the dominate monster spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC . On a failed saving throw, it is recalled, while on a success, it is not. Combat. In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can’t take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to. Rest . A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can’t spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points. Items. Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type. Item Bonding . Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can’t attune to magic items, unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so (e.g. Proto-Attunement.) Companion Barding . You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small. In addition, the cost is further doubled if the companion is not humanoid in shape. Companion Barding Cost Size Humanoid Shape Cost Abstract Shape Cost Tiny 0.5x 1x Small 1x 2x Medium 1x 2x Large 2x 4x Huge 4x 8x Soul Bond 1st-level Tamer feature Companions make death saving throws, die, and can be revived like any player character. A companion that has been stabilised remains unconscious until it regains hit points, or until you finish a long rest. Companions that are stable and have 0 hit points when you finish a long rest regain half their maximum hit points. You have a pool of healing power equal to five times your tamer level that replenishes when you finish a long rest. Whenever you finish a short rest, you can choose to draw power from that pool, restoring a total number of hit points amongst your companions up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Monster Trainer 1st-level Tamer feature As you gain levels in this class, your companions become more powerful. Your companions use your proficiency bonus instead of their own, potentially increasing their attack, saving throw, and skill modifiers, and their saving throw DC s. Training. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement from gaining a level in the tamer class, you pass on your hardened resolve to all your companions, causing them to gain 1 additional Hit Die. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Whenever you gain a level beyond 1st in this class, each companion to which you are bonded gains one of the following improvements. The familiars in Chapter 8 have unique improvements that can be taken instead of these. Any newly gained companions receive these additional Hit Dice and improvements as if you had them since your 1st level in tamer. Companion Improvement Training Table Improvement Effect Speed Training Increase one existing speed by 15 feet up to a maximum of 150% of the creature’s base speed, rounded up to the nearest 5-foot increment*. Toughen Up Your companion gains an additional Hit Die, increasing its hit point maximum. Increase your companion’s hit point maximum by rolling this Hit Die and adding your companion’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 0). Ability Boost Increase one of your companion's ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20. Go For the Throat Your companion gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls made with its natural weapons or unarmed strikes**. Survival Instincts Your companion gains proficiency in one saving throw. War Training Your companion gains proficiency with one armour type or two weapons***. *E.g., a base speed of 30 feet can be increased to 45 feet maximum, a base speed of 25 feet can be increased to 40 feet, and a base speed of 20 feet to 30 feet. **Your companions can each benefit from this feature once. When you reach 5th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature twice. When you reach 9th level in this class, your companions can each benefit from this feature three times. This improvement does not affect attacks made with weapons. ***Your companion can’t gain proficiency in medium and heavy armour until it has gained proficiency in the prerequisite lighter armour types. For example, to gain proficiency in heavy armour, you must take this improvement 3 times: light, then medium, then heavy. Work with your GM to figure out if and how a creature can wield shields and weapons.

This is indicated by the value ‘6/1’ in the ‘CR 1’ column and the level ‘10’ row. Tame Creature 1st-level Tamer feature One way to defeat deadly foes: have deadlier friends. As you explore, you will encounter new creatures which you may wish to make your companions. You can tame a Small or smaller creature of CR ½ or lower, as described below. As you gain levels in this class, the size and challenge rating of creatures you can tame increases, as shown in the Tamer Companion Summary table. Vessel. To tame a companion, you must first prepare a vessel using special inks, gems, or other materials. Preparing the vessel takes 8 hours of work and components with a value in gold pieces equal to at least one hundred times the target creature’s CR. Vessels and Cost At 4th level, you can capture creatures of CR 1 and below. To capture a CR ½ or CR 1 creature, you need a vessel worth 50 gp or 100 gp, respectively. If you try to use a vessel worth 50 gp to capture a CR 1 creature, the creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and the vessel can be recovered. You can always break down the components of an old vessel to craft a new one as part of the vessel preparation process. You can release a companion from a vessel at any point. The vessel remains intact, and can be used to tame a new creature. Taming a Creature . As an action, you can throw an empty vessel at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your tamer spell save DC or be trapped within the vessel. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if: It is a humanoid, giant, or swarm. It is larger than your maximum companion size (use a creature’s unaltered size if it is under the influence of a size-changing magical effect, such as enlarge/reduce ). It has a higher CR than your maximum companion CR (see the Tamer Companion Summary table). It has a higher CR than the vessel can capture. It has more than half of its hit points. If a creature doesn’t automatically succeed on this saving throw for one of the above reasons, and has either fewer than ten hit points or one-quarter of its hit points, it automatically fails this saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw is trapped in your vessel and becomes your companion when you next finish a long rest. Lost Traits . When a creature becomes your companion, it loses the following from its stat block: The ability to cast any spells (though it retains its spells known, see Psychic Bond). Any summoning actions or actions that create additional creatures (such as a wraith’s Create Specter action or an ooze’s Split reaction). The Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and Legendary Resistance traits. Any legendary actions and legendary action options. Any lair actions and regional effects. Any mythic traits and mythic action options. Optional Rule: Non-Combat Taming If a player impresses a celestial with an especially noble act, or rears a creature from an egg, that creature might be willing to become a tamer’s companion. If so, feel free to ignore the usual rules regarding saving throws on taming, and let the beautiful story of companionship unfold! Abilities and Proficiency As your companions’ ability scores change—often through Companion Improvement Training—their skill modifiers, saving throws, attack modifiers, and saving throw DC s will also change. Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work. First you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, s ubtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DC s. For save DC s, subtract an additional 8 from the DC . Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers. Let’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC ), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution ( DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modifier). If the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively. Spellcasting 2nd-level Tamer feature By 2nd level, you have learned to harness your mental fortitude to augment the potential of others. You can cast tamer spells. Cantrips At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the tamer spell list. You learn additional tamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Tamer table. Spell Slots The Tamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your tamer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these tamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the tamer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Tamer table shows when you learn more tamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the tamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability When you gain your first level in this class, choose whether you use your knowledge (Intelligence), willpower (Wisdom), or force of personality (Charisma) as your spellcasting ability for your tamer spells. You use this spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a creature’s vessel as a spellcasting focus for your tamer spells. Powerful Companion Abilities Some monster features are very powerful, and aren’t designed for use by players. The two most common are recharge actions and gazes. You can help make a companion more balanced by changing these features slightly. It’s advised to approach this on a case-by-case basis, as each feature is different, and some might not require changing. Recharge Abilities. Some creatures’ actions have the addendum “Recharge (5-6)”. This means that after a creature uses that action, it can’t use it again until it has recharged. At the start of the creature’s turn, you roll a d6, and if the result is a 5 or higher, the action recharges. No class has recharge abilities, in part because they add a lot of randomness to the game. Instead of using this recharge mechanic, you can simply change any ability with a recharge to one of the following: Recharge Condition Companion Recharge Recharge (4-6) Recharges after 1 minute Recharge (5-6) Recharges after 10 minutes Recharge (6) Recharges on a short or long rest Perpetually Active Abilities. Some traits, like a medusa’s Petrifying Gaze, which is perpetually active and has the power of a 6th level spell, have the potential to become overpowered and repetitive. To balance this, you can add the caveat that “after a creature makes a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the effect for the next 24 hours ”. Work with your GM to find a balanced solution for your game. Bolster 2nd-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you and you are holding its vessel, or if you are holding its vessel with it inside, you can use an action to expend one spell slot to restore hit points to your companion equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1) plus an additional 2d4 per level of the spell slot expended. Psychic Bond 2nd-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your companion’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the companion has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. Spell Swap. While your companion is summoned, is within 100 feet of you, and you hold its vessel, any spells your companion knows are added to your known spells. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range of self or touch, your companion can be the target of that spell. Pocket Family 3rd-level Tamer feature As you gain levels in this class, the number of companions and maximum size of companion to which you can become bonded increases. You can be bonded to two, three, four, five, or six creatures at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, respectively. Your companions can be sized Medium at 5th level, Large at 11th level, and Huge at 17th level. If you are already bonded to your maximum number of companions and become bonded to a new companion, you must choose one existing companion to release from its vessel. When you bond with a new companion, the companion gains improvements and Hit Dice based on its CR and your tamer level. See the Tamer Companion Summary table for details. Training Paradigm 3rd-level Tamer feature You choose the type of Training Paradigm you follow from the list of available paradigms, which are detailed after the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, and 14th level. At 18th level, the 7th-level feature is improved. Ability Score Improvement 4th-level Tamer feature When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Multiattack 5th-level Tamer feature Through rigorous training, you can access the innate fury of your companions. When you take a bonus action or action to command your companion, you can command it to use its Multiattack action, if it has one. Malleable Presence 5th-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour towards one creature you can see as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the aggressive or cautious behaviours. At the start of each of the target creature’s turns for the next minute , it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your tamer spell save DC if it is within 30 feet of your companion and can see your companion. On a failure, it suffers the effects of the associated behaviour until the start of its next turn. On a success, it is unaffected. Aggressive. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion. Cautious. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 5 feet of the attacker. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Alpha Strike 6th-level Tamer feature While summoning a companion, your psychic connection is at its closest, allowing you to quickly relay your intent. As part of the action to summon a companion, you can command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action, which it does so on its turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest. Wilful Blows 6th-level Tamer feature Your magical potency is channeled through your companions’ strikes. Your companions’ attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Switcheroo 13th-level Tamer feature You learn how to switch places with your companion in the nick of time. While you and your companion are within 100 feet of each other, you can use a bonus action, or a reaction when you or your companion is the target of an attack by an attacker you can see, to magically switch places with your companion. If performed as a reaction, the creature that appears in the targeted creature’s space becomes the new target of the attack. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your tamer spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Magnificent Presence 17th-level Tamer feature While your companion is within 100 feet of you, you can order it to change its behaviour as part of the bonus action or action you use to command it. Choose either the provoking poise or shrinking violet behaviours. Provoking Poise . For the next minute , your companion draws the attention of nearby creatures. While within 15 feet of your companion, any creature that is hostile towards your companion and that can see it has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against creatures other than your companion. Shrinking Violet. For the next minute , your companion appears small and unassuming, making little noise. Any creature that is hostile towards your companion has disadvantage on attack rolls against your companion if there is another creature hostile towards the attacker within 15 feet of the attacker. After you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Summon the Horde 20th-level Tamer feature In times of great need, a tamer can summon many of its companions simultaneously. As an action, you can summon additional companions which remain summoned for 1 minute . You can have a maximum of three companions summoned simultaneously as a result of using this feature. As an action on subsequent turns, you can issue mental commands to all your companions at once, allowing them to take an action in their stat block or some other action. You choose the order in which your companions act each round. After the minute elapses, all your companions bar one (which you choose) return to their vessels and a wave of lethargy sweeps over you; you can’t move or take actions until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Tamer Paradigms Leader (wis) Infuser (wis) Necromancer (wis) Splicer (wis)",

But as her fists clench and eyes flash, the spell harmlessly fizzles in the very air above them. The tiny gnome thoughtfully strokes his long beard as he contemplates the vile creature slowly moving toward him, its jagged sword flashing in the torchlight. He sneers as the strange, eye-shaped tattoo on his forehead opens to fire a beam of powerful energy at the creature, rendering it momentarily stunned, and quickly follows it up with a barrage of spells from each hand. Twirling his hands in intricate circles, the human furiously shapes and manipulates his spells while casting them. A fiery ball made of solid ice erupts from his hand, exploding among friend and foe alike, though only affecting his enemies while leaving his companions unharmed. Some spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and texts. Others devote themselves to the gods, acting as emissaries of the divine. The theurge seeks to achieve a perfect balance between the arcane and the divine, blending both kinds of magic into a powerful and cohesive whole. Blending the Arcane and the Divine Theurges revel in the unbridled wonders of magic, regardless of its source. They strive to refine their magical abilities, driven by their quest to accomplish ever greater feats of spellcasting. Many consider the theurge to be the epitome of what it means to be a spellcaster. The Divinity of Magic Although many theurges worship a specific deity, often one devoted to magic, others choose to venerate personifications of magical forces or perhaps even magic itself. Theurges typically possess an unquenchable and obsessive thirst to further their understanding and mastery of spellcasting and magic. Their might lies in their ability to draw upon, combine, and manipulate multiple forms of magical power to overcome any obstacle.

Were you born with this ability? Were your powers a gift from a deity? Did you learn your craft through countless hours of solitary study? You should also decide if you are a religious individual, actively working to promote the will of one or more particular deities. Alternatively, do you believe magic itself is worthy of divine reverence without the need for gods? Or perhaps you are an academic person, one who treats the acquisition of spells and magical power as a purely intellectual endeavor separate from the acknowledgement of such divinity. Quick Build You can make a theurge quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the occultist (see Tome of Heroes) background or the acolyte from the core game. Class Features As a theurge, you gain the following class features. Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d6 per theurge level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per theurge level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs Tools: None Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by yo a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus or holy symbol a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack A theurgic libram Spellcasting As a student of magic, you can cast cleric and wizard spells. Cantrips At 1st level, you know one cantrip of your choice from the cleric spell list, one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list, and a third cantrip from either the cleric or wizard spell list (your choice). You learn additional cleric or wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Theurge table. Theurgic Libram At 1st level, you learn the ritual to create a theurgic libram. This ritual takes 1 hour, during which time you construct your libram and then magically bond with it. Your theurgic libram contains six 1st-level spells of your choice. You can choose these spells from the cleric or wizard spell lists, but at least two of these spells must be from the cleric spell list and at least two must be from the wizard spell list. The spells that you add to your theurgic libram as you gain levels reflect the magical and esoteric research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have made about the nature of magic. Replacing the Libram. If your theurgic libram is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one by performing the same ritual, which requires a number of hours equal to the highest spell level contained in your libram (so if the libram contained 1st-level spells only, the ritual to replace it takes 1 hour, but if the libram contained 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-level spells, the ritual takes 3 hours). The contents of your new libram are identical to the contents of your previous libram. You can’t have more than one theurgic libram at a time. If it still exists, your previous libram vanishes the moment you complete the ritual to create a replacement libram. Libram’s Appearance . Your theurgic libram is a unique compilation of spells with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might appear plain and functional, resembling a gift you once received from your master, or be a finely bound, gilt-edged prayer tome worthy of an ancient temple or even be a simple, dog-eared journal you crafted yourself. Preparing and Casting Spells The Theurge table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric or wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. You prepare the list of cleric and wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of cleric or wizard spells from your theurgic libram equal to your Intelligence modifier + your theurge level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level theurge, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your theurgic libram. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds or magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your theurgic libram and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your prepared spell list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for both your cleric and wizard spells since you learn your spells through dedicated study and mental discipline. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric or wizard spell that you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a cleric or wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your theurgic libram. You don’t need to have the spell prepared to cast it as a ritual. Spellcasting Focus You can use either an arcane focus or holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for both your cleric and wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a theurge level, you can add three spells of your choice from the cleric or wizard spell lists to your libram. At least one of these spells must be from the cleric spell list, and at least one must be from the wizard spell list. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Theurge table. Spell Nexus While your theurgic libram is on your person, you can use a bonus action to open a magical conduit between you and it, allowing you to instantly replace one spell you currently have prepared with another spell of the same level transcribed within the libram. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level theurge, you could instantly replace one 1st-level spell you currently have prepared with another 1st-level spell transcribed in your libram. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. Summon Libram At 2nd level, you are able to sense the location of your theurgic libram, as long as it is within 100 feet of you. If your libram is within this range, you can use a bonus action to cause it to instantly teleport to your hand. Beginning at 9th level, you can sense the location of your theurgic libram and summon it to you as long as it is on the same plane of existence as you. If the libram is not on the same plane of existence, you learn which plane it is on but not the exact location within the plane. Theurgic Devotion When you reach 3rd level, you choose a theurgic devotion which shapes your practice of magic. Choose one of the devotions detailed later in this section: the Dweomercrafter, Mystic, or Spell Siphon devotion. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Theurgic Insight Starting at 5th level, you gain a pool of Theurgic Insight dice. Your Theurgic Insight dice start off as d6, and they become d8 at 11th level and d10 at 17th level. The number of Theurgic Insight dice in this pool is equal to your proficiency bonus. When you make an ability check that uses either the Arcana or Religion proficiencies, you can expend one Theurgic Insight die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check but must do so before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail. You regain any expended Theurgic Insight dice when you finish a long rest. Superior Focus At 7th level, you can simultaneously maintain two spells that require concentration. One spell must be from the wizard spell list, and the other must be from the cleric spell list. You must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the highest-level spell cast) at the beginning of each round in which you are attempting to maintain concentration on two spells. If you fail this save, you immediately lose both spells. Additionally, while concentrating on two spells, you roll with disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration whenever you take damage. Anything that causes you to lose concentration, including being incapacitated or killed, causes you to lose both spells. Spell Synthesis Beginning at 9th level, you can cast one wizard spell and one cleric spell that you have prepared on your turn. Both spells must be of 3rd level or lower, and each must have a casting time of 1 action or a bonus action. You expend spell slots for each spell as normal. Due to the intense effort this requires, you can’t take a reaction on the same round you use Spell Synthesis. You must finish a long rest before you can use Spell Synthesis again. Beginning at 13th level, you can use Spell Synthesis twice between rests, and the maximum level of the spells you can cast increases to 4th level. At 18th level, you can use Spell Synthesis three times between rests, and the maximum level of the spells you can cast increases to 5th level. When you finish a long rest, you regain any expended uses of Spell Synthesis. Innate Spells At 15th level, your mastery over spells allows you to cast a small number of them at will. You can choose a 1st-level cleric spell and a 1st-level wizard in your theurgic libram. These spells may not be from the evocation school of magic. You can cast these spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either of these spells at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. When you reach 17th level, you can add one additional cleric or wizard spell from your theurgic libram to your list of innate spells. This spell can be of either 1st level or 2nd level. In addition, you can now cast your innate spells without needing to prepare them. As part of a long rest, you can exchange any of your innate spells for different spells in your theurgic libram of the same levels. Theurge Supreme At 20th level, you can use Spell Nexus a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, when you take damage, you no longer make your Constitution saving throws with disadvantage when using Superior Focus to maintain concentration on two spells.",

        "description": "Commander Battles, wars, conquests, and defeats. Victors, losers, land gained, and ground lost. Survivors and triumphant ones, and those who fell in defeat. You are a seasoned fighter. A veteran of many battles now growing weary with the world, you find little solace in your past. The sword at your side is a tool of violence used to decide the outcome of debates and other matters. You conquer the enemies of your commander, be they kings, dukes, or warlords. They all seek power and have previously relied on your violent prowess to achieve their goals. It is time to fight for your side, yet you still may not have discovered what that may be. Are you a hero, a villain, or a bystander who refuses to choose any side? Only time will reveal your true nature, whatever that may be. d4 Reasons for Retirement from Military Service 1 Neglect of Home: While you tirelessly fought battles in distant realms against foreign enemies, you overlooked matters at home. A loved one succumbed to a severe illness due to lost letters and confusion, haunting you with the regret of arriving too late to aid them in their time of need. 2 Betrayal of Strategies: Your superiors went against your strategies in a decisive battle, resulting in a death sentence for thousands of soldiers. The faces of those under your command, marching towards certain doom, are etched in your memory. Your anger and rejection of these decisions led to your dismissal from the army. 3 Numbness to Suffering: After numerous battles and wars, you become desensitized to the suffering of others. One morning, the glance of an orphaned child pierced through your numbness, revealing the lost hope in his youthful eyes. This encounter forced a stark realization upon you, prompting you to no longer sow destruction in your path. 4 Defeat by a Superior Adversary: Despite leading your fighters into countless battles, you encountered a superior adversary that proved impossible. Crushing defeat of your forces and the loss of faith in your strategies by your superiors led to your selection as a scapegoat and subsequent dismissal from your position. Level Proficiency | Vet.

        "name": "Warden",
        "description": "An immense goblinoid army stretches from the horizon to the castle walls. In the breach, a single knight holds back the horde, eviscerating all comers, and allowing none to pass. Blood dripping from his blade, a scarred half-orc gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint, his eyes alight with bestial fury. Advancing slowly, an elf brandishing a green scimitar emerges from the foliage before two poachers. Startled, they turn to run, but find their feet bound fast by leaves and vines. Wardens are vigilant guardians that adopt a charge—be it a kingdom, a forest, or an individual—and safeguard it from harm. Through both their fortitude and shields, they are immovable bulwarks on the field of battle. Guardian’s Call Every warden feels a gravitational pull to defend the helpless. Sometimes, they are directly called, such as when a village or tribe selects their mightiest member to defend them, or when the spirits of a sacred grove beckon a new champion to protect their forest. Other times, the warden is compelled by more subtle means, such as witnessing uncontested injustice, or feeling the weight of responsibility when tragedy occurs. The result is the same: wardens that conclude their minds and pick up their shields to answer the call. Wherever wardens travel, new calls make themselves evident. There is never a shortage of those in need, whereas those with strength and conscience are perpetually in short supply. Primal Strength Wardens are like mighty trees in a gale storm or the rocks along the shore, constantly battered by waves. They demonstrate almost supernatural resilience to hardship, and can’t be easily broken or slain. Most wardens draw their might from the wild—the strength of the earth beneath their feet and the vitality of the air in their lungs—though some attribute their resiliency to an inward resolve or the absolute belief in a deity. Regardless of its source, a warden’s power is intuitive and forceful, allowing them to stop foes dead in their tracks, mark those standing in their way, and shug off otherwise deadly conditions. Only those wardens who choose to defend an obviously magical charge appear to be supernatural; others simply possess a daunting force of will and bottomless tolerance for punishment. Creating a Warden When creating a warden, consider what drives you. What brought you to raise up your shield for others? Do you fight to protect an individual or a particular location? A threat to your homeland or loved ones might have been your catalyst, but you also might have risen to combat a menace to the natural world. What was your call, and how do you honor it? What motivates you to keep fighting, even when you’re at death’s door? Most wardens have been recognized as exemplary defenders. Perhaps, you are known as a wandering knight of the northern provinces, or perhaps you were beckoned by spirits of the forest to protect them from invaders. Who has called you, and how did you respond? Quick Build You can build a warden quickly with these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score, followed by Strength and Dexterity. Then, choose the Primal Toughness option for Sentinel’s Stand. Finally, choose any background, preferably one that sheds light on your history of guardianship.

At 1st level, choose one of the following features. Armor Proficiency You gain proficiency with heavy armor. Primal Toughness Your hit point maximum increases by 1 + your Constitution modifier, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level in this class. Stalwart Spirit You gain proficiency in one saving throw of your choice. Warden’s Grasp At 1st level, as a bonus action, you can use the force of your daunting presence to ensnare nearby enemies into combat. Until the start of your next turn, you can’t move, and each Large or smaller creature you choose within 5 feet of you can’t willingly move away from you unless it first takes the Disengage action. At 14th level, the range of this ability increases to 10 feet. Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Crippling When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 0, until the end of its next turn, and it can’t take the Dash action until the end of its turn. Great Weapon Fighting When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Protection When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a weapon or shield. Titan Fighting You gain a +2 bonus to melee weapon attacks you make against Large or larger creatures. Warden’s Mark At 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to mark a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. While a marked creature is within 5 feet of you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you. The mark lasts for 1 minute, or until you mark another creature or become incapacitated. At 11th level, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action against a creature you have marked. Champion’s Call By the time you reach 3rd level, you feel the inexorable pull of an important duty or task that you assume as your own. No outside force compels your choice or enforces your conduct; if you fail in your charge, you alone are responsible. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 13th, and 20th level. Warden’s Resolve Starting at 3rd level, whenever your hit points are less than half your maximum, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Starting at 17th level, when your hit points are less than half your maximum, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Font of Life By 4th level, you can use your action to end either one disease or one condition afflicting you. The condition can be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. You can use this action even if the condition you end would otherwise prevent it. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 15th level, when you use this feature, you can choose to restore your hit points to half your maximum, if they were lower. Once you restore your hit points in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Extra Attack Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Sentinel’s Step Wardens are faultless trackers who can navigate hazardous terrain with ease. At 7th level, select one of the following features. Earthstrength You possess the might of the earth itself. Your carrying capacity doubles, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws you make to prevent being moved against your will or knocked prone. Thundering Charge During the first round of combat, your speed increases by 30 feet and you have advantage on the first melee weapon attack you make. Wildblood Your reflexes have been honed by the perils of nature. You can’t be surprised while you are conscious. Additionally, you have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores. Undying At 9th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and aren’t killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Interrupt Starting at 10th level, when a creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to prevent one of its subsequent strikes. If the creature could make additional attacks before the end of the turn, it can make one fewer than normal. Sentinel’s Soul Wardens are unshakable guardians that can’t be bowed. At 18th level, choose one of the following features: Ageless Guardian You are immune to poison and disease, no longer need food or water, suffer none of the frailty of old age, and can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws. Eyes of the Mountain You gain tremorsense with a range of 15 feet, and you can detect the presence of hidden or invisible creatures within 30 feet of you. Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws. Impenetrable Mind Your thoughts can’t be read, and you can’t be charmed or frightened. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws. Champion’s Call A warden’s call is a binding charge to protect and defend others from harm. Every warden eventually hears a call, and responds with mighty deeds. In answering this call, wardens embrace the traits of those they stand to protect, gaining primal, and sometimes even mystical, abilities.

        "name": "Warlock",
        "description": "With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel⁠ to his will. As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic. Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world. Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power. Sworn and Beholden A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric⁠ and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf. The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness⁠ or to read any language) to access to powerful spells⁠. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat⁠. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons. Delvers into Secrets Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well. Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends⁠ are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void. Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure. Creating a Warlock As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you sea⁠rch for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you? Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures. What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron? How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries. Quick Build You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the eldritch blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells charm person and witch bolt .

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light⁠ armor Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma Skills: Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipmen⁠t granted by your background: ( a ) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or ( b ) any simple weapon ( a ) a component pouch or ( b ) an arcane focus ( a ) a scholar’s pack or ( b ) a dungeoneer’s pack Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers Otherworldly Patron At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Pact Magic Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See the general rules of spellcasting and the warlock spell list. Cantrip⁠s You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantr⁠ips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantri⁠ps Known column of the Warlock table. Spell Slots The Warlock table shows how many spe⁠ll slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt , you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells⁠ of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting⁠ Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Cha⁠risma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Char⁠isma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. Eldritch Invocations In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations , fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. Pact Boon At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Pact of the Chain You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special⁠ forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction. Pact of the Blade You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see Weapons for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special⁠ ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. Pact of the Tome Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book⁠ of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cant⁠rips at will. They don’t count against your number of cant⁠rips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book⁠ of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Your Pact Boon Each Pact Boon option produces a special⁠ creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature. Pact of the Chain⁠. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it. Pact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye. Pact of the Tome. Your Book⁠ of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells⁠ of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Mystic Arcanum At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. Eldritch Master At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spe⁠ll slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spe⁠ll slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. Otherworldly Patrons The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list , they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Mystic Arcanum At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic A rcanum when you finish a long rest. Eldritch Master At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. Eldritch Invocations If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. Agonizing Blast Prerequisite : eldritch blast cantrip When you cast eldritch blast , add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. Armor of Shadows You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

Bewitching Whispers Prerequisite : 7th level You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Book of Ancient Secrets Prerequisite : Pact of the Tome feature You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. Chains of Carceri Prerequisite : 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature You can cast hold monster at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again. Devil’s Sight You can see normally in darkness , both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

Gaze of Two Minds You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. Lifedrinker Prerequisite : 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Mask of Many Faces You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.

Visions of Distant Realms Prerequisite : 15th level You can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot. Voice of the Chain Master Prerequisite : Pact of the Chain feature You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech. Whispers of the Grave Prerequisite : 9th level You can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot. Witch Sight Prerequisite : 15th level You can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight. Otherworldly Patrons The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals. The Fiend You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths. Expanded Spell List The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. Table: Fiend Expanded Spells Spell Level Spells 1st Burning Hands , command 2nd Blindness/Deafness , scorching ray 3rd fireball , stinking cloud 4th Fire Shield , wall of fire 5th Flame Strike , hallow Dark One’s Blessing Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1). Dark One’s Own Luck Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Fiendish Resilience Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. Hurl Through Hell Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Your Pact Boon Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature. Pact of the Chain . Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Pact of the Blade . If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. Pact of the Tome . Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.",

        "description": "An Occultist Empowered by Otherworldly Pacts Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power. Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them. Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “ Eldritch Invocation Options ” section later in this class’s description. Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock , you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5. Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table . You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise. Level 1: Pact Magic Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells , which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table . Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest . For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock , you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt , you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells . Charm Person and Hex are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table . Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell , which can be of levels 1–3. If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells . Level 2: Magical Cunning You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 3: Warlock Subclass You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron , Celestial Patron , Fiend Patron , and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 9: Contact Patron In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw . Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 11: Mystic Arcanum Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. As shown in the Warlock Features table , you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 ( level 7 spell ), 15 ( level 8 spell ), and 17 ( level 9 spell ). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest . Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. Level 20: Eldritch Master When you use your Magical Cunning feature , you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots. Eldritch Invocation Options Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order. Agonizing Blast Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage rolls . Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip .

Devil’s Sight Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness —both magical and nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself. Devouring Blade Prerequisite: Level 12+ Warlock, Thirsting Blade Invocation The Extra Attack of your Thirsting Blade invocation confers two extra attacks rather than one.

Eldritch Spear Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage and has a range of 10+ feet. When you cast that spell, its range increases by a number of feet equal to 30 times your Warlock level. Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip . Fiendish Vigor Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast False Life on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don’t roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points ; you automatically get the highest number on the die. Gaze of Two Minds Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature , and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature’s space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other. Gift of the Depths Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed . You can also cast Water Breathing once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a Long Rest . Gift of the Protectors Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome Invocation A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name). When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a Long Rest . As a Magic action , you can erase a name on the page by touching it. Investment of the Chain Master Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain Invocation When you cast Find Familiar , you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits. Aerial or Aquatic. The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet. Quick Attack. As a Bonus Action , you can command the familiar to take the Attack action . Necrotic or Radiant Damage. Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning , Piercing , or Slashing damage , you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead. Your Save DC. If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. Resistance. When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage. Lessons of the First Ones Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice (see chapter 5 ).

Lifedrinker Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic , Psychic , or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature , and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point ).

Otherworldly Leap Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast Jump on yourself without expending a spell slot. Pact of the Blade As a Bonus Action , you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus . Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity ; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic , Psychic , or Radiant damage or its normal damage type . Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends. Pact of the Chain You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp , Pseudodragon , Quasit , Skeleton , Slaad Tadpole , Sphinx of Wonder , Sprite , or Venomous Snake (see appendix B for the familiar’s stat block). Additionally, when you take the Attack action , you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction . Pact of the Tome Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest . This Book of Shadows (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die. Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag.

They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power. Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them. Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options” section later in this class’s description. Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5. Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table. You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise. Level 1: Pact Magic Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table. Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest. For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt , you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3. If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level. Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells. Level 2: Magical Cunning You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Level 3: Warlock Subclass You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 9: Contact Patron In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. Level 11: Mystic Arcanum Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended. Level 20: Eldritch Master When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots. Eldritch Invocation Options Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical order. Agonizing Blast Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You can add your Charisma modifier to that spell’s damage rolls. Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip. Armor of Shadows You can cast Mage Armor on yourself without expending a spell slot. Ascendant Step Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can cast Levitate on yourself without expending a spell slot. Devil’s Sight Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness—both magical and nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself. Devouring Blade Prerequisite: Level 12+ Warlock, Thirsting Blade Invocation The Extra Attack of your Thirsting Blade invocation confers two extra attacks rather than one. Eldritch Mind You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain Concentration. Eldritch Smite Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 Force damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the Prone condition if it is Huge or smaller. Eldritch Spear Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage and has a range of 10+ feet. When you cast that spell, its range increases by a number of feet equal to 30 times your Warlock level. Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip. Fiendish Vigor Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast False Life on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don’t roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points; you automatically get the highest number on the die. Gaze of Two Minds Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature’s space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other. Gift of the Depths Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed. You can also cast Water Breathing once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a Long Rest. Gift of the Protectors Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome Invocation A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name). When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a Long Rest. As a Magic action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it. Investment of the Chain Master Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain Invocation When you cast Find Familiar , you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits. Aerial or Aquatic. The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet. Quick Attack. As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action. Necrotic or Radiant Damage. Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead. Your Save DC. If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. Resistance. When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage. Lessons of the First Ones Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice (see chapter 5). Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different Origin feat. Lifedrinker Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point). Mask of Many Faces Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast Disguise Self without expending a spell slot. Master of Myriad Forms Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock You can cast Alter Self without expending a spell slot. Misty Visions Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast Silent Image without expending a spell slot. One with Shadows Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock While you’re in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast Invisibility on yourself without expending a spell slot. Otherworldly Leap Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock You can cast Jump on yourself without expending a spell slot. Pact of the Blade As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus. Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type. Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends. Pact of the Chain You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp , Pseudodragon , Quasit , Skeleton , Slaad Tadpole , Sphinx of Wonder , Sprite , or Venomous Snake (see appendix B for the familiar’s stat block). Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction. Pact of the Tome Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This Book of Shadows (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die. Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you. Spellcasting Focus. You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus. Repelling Blast Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that requires an attack roll. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from you. Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip. Thirsting Blade Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once when you take the Attack action on your turn. Visions of Distant Realms Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock You can cast Arcane Eye without expending a spell slot. Whispers of the Grave Prerequisite: Level 7+ Warlock You can cast Speak with Dead without expending a spell slot. Witch Sight Prerequisite: Level 15+ Warlock You have Truesight with a range of 30 feet. Warlock Spell List This section presents the Warlock spell list.

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.\\\\nWhen you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.\\\\nYou can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.\\\"}\"},{\"name\":\"Eldritch Invocations

Magic\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows-its identity unclear-but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.\\\\nCantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\\\\nWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\\\\nSpell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1-5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\\\\nFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.\\\\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are recommended.\\\\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1-3.\\\\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\\\\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\\\\nSpellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\\\\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.\\\"}\"},{\"name\":\"Warlock Charisma Spellcasting\",\"parent\":\"Pact

        "description": "An elf recites the motions for the simplest spell she knows, repeating them until she knows they are perfect. With a single, precise stroke, she unleashes a wave of arcane energy, focused into a searing blue beam. A tiefling waves her hands to conjure floating greatswords of humming blue energy that dance about in mesmerizing and deadly arcs. One blade takes on an aspect of fire, and the other lightning, as she begins to cleave through the goblinoid horde. Waving a black-and-red checkered banner, a dragonborn king charges into the fore. At his sides are warmages of all houses, a chessboard of elite arcanists, poised to turn the tide of battle. The undisputed masters of cantrips, warmages turn the most fundamental types of magic into a deadly and precise art. Cantrip Masters While other spellcasters aspire to grander and more complex spells, warmages refine and master the most fundamental magic: cantrips. Warmages wield their magic in the same way that a warrior uses a sword, bow, or axe—as weapons to be perfected, not as an unknowable force to be feared. In contrast to sorcerers and wizards, their magic is a trainable skill, one that can be mastered by almost anyone with discipline and aptitude. Therefore, warmages stand among the most fearsome of spellcasters, with only the most rudimentary of spells. Strategic Geniuses Warmages have a long and storied history as masterful strategists and tacticians, both in grand battles and personal skirmishes. If a warmage is outgunned or outmanned, they’ll try to outthink their foes, which works more often than not. Warmages demonstrate an efficient kind of pragmatism, owing perhaps to their ability to solve many problems with just a few magical tools. Aligned Free Agents While some warmages are fully self-taught, the majority join a house: a loose confederation of warmages who practice together and share secrets of the trade. Houses teach invaluable battlefield strategy, but each individual house also touts their own brands of tactics and styles of magical tricks. The House of Knights, for example, emphasizes armor and martial prowess, whereas the House of Kings emphasizes battlefield strategy. By way of metaphor, houses that value honor and teamwork above all else brand themselves after games of strategy, whereas those who epitomize self-reliance name themselves for games of chance. This division in the warmage houses is representative of a schism that dates back to the earliest warmage masters. Legend has it that the first two masters separated when one decided to found a college. The other, out of spite, built a casino outside its grounds. Creating a Warmage Warmages come from all walks of life, so as you build yours, consider where you first learned the fundamentals of magic, which you would go on to perfect. You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be self-taught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character’s history with magic. Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot? Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal? Lastly, consider your prospective warmage House. Though you don’t choose one until reaching 3rd level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights. Quick Build You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the House of Knights. Then choose the chill touch, force dart, force weapon, and phantom grapnel cantrips, and the Adventurer Arcane Initiation. Pick any background that emphasizes your magical discipline.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per warmage level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warmage level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: One artisan’s kit of your choice, one gaming set of your choice Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Arcana, Athletics, History, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: Leather armor, a dagger, and any simple weapon (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) an explorer’s pack or (b) a scholar’s pack A gaming set Spellcasting At 1st level, you begin to learn the simple, yet potent, brand of spellcasting for which warmages are known. Cantrips You know four cantrips of your choice from the warmage spell list. You learn additional warmage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warmage table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warmage cantrips you know and replace it with another warmage cantrip. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warmage spells, since you learn your spells through practice and mental discipline. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells. Arcane Initiation Warmages come from all backgrounds and walks of life. At 1st level, choose where you first learned the basics of magic. The cantrips offered by your initiation don’t count against your number of cantrips known. Adventurer You picked up your magic informally by traveling with a dozen different mages over the years. You learn the mage hand and ray of frost cantrips. Circus Performer You learned a few simple tricks to participate in a sideshow or circus act. You learn the dancing lights and minor illusion cantrips. Eldritch Event An influx of insidious magic left an imprint on you. You learn the chill touch and message cantrips. Mercenary You mastered the fundamentals of war magic to engage in battle with similarly armed arcanists. You learn the arc blade and true strike cantrips. Temple A monastery or temple educated you in the ways of gentle healing magic. You learn the sacred flame and spare the dying cantrips. Tower Apprentice You apprenticed under a spellcaster for some time, who taught you the fundamentals of arcana. You learn the prestidigitation and shocking grasp cantrips. Self-Taught You taught yourself all the fundamentals of magic from a dusty old tome or abandoned scroll. You learn the fire bolt and light cantrips. Survival To survive in the wilderness, you taught yourself to cast simple spells. You learn the druidcraft and shillelagh cantrips. Arcane Fighting Style Warmages learn that magic is the purest of weapons, and can be wielded just as easily as any other. At 1st level, choose one of the following fighting styles: Blaster You gain a +1 bonus to the saving throw DCs of your warmage spells. Deflector When you have at least one hand free and a creature hits you with a spell attack or a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class for that attack, potentially causing it to miss. Resistive While you are wearing light armor or are under the effects of the mage armor spell, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. Sniper You gain a +1 bonus to ranged spell attack rolls. Additionally, your warmage cantrips ignore half cover. Striker When you hit a creature with a cantrip that requires a melee attack and exceed the target’s AC by 5 or more or score a critical hit, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll. Warmage Edge Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you deal damage with a warmage cantrip, you can improve one damage roll of the spell, adding your Intelligence modifier to the roll if you don’t already add it. Starting at 5th level, and as you gain levels in this class, you also add extra dice to the damage roll of your warmage cantrips, as shown in the Cantrip Bonus Dice column of the Warmage table. For example, when you are at 5th level, you can improve the damage of the fire bolt cantrip to deal fire damage equal to 3d10 + your Intelligence modifier on a hit. Warmage Tricks Beginning at 2nd level, you learn to use Warmage Tricks, special techniques that alter the way you fight, move, and cast your spells. You learn two tricks of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. At higher levels, you learn additional tricks as shown in the Tricks Known column of the Warmage table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tricks you know and replace it with another trick for which you meet the prerequisites. Warmage House Upon reaching 3rd level, you choose a Warmage House that teaches you a suite of magical strategies. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Arcane Surge Starting at 5th level, you learn to tap into a vast reservoir of magical power and unleash it upon your foes. Once on each of your turns, when you deal damage with a warmage cantrip, you can double the number of damage dice dealt by the spell. You can’t use this feature on a spell that has scored a critical hit. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Starting at 11th level, you can use this feature twice between rests. Tactical Insight At 6th level, you learn how to use ambient magical power to defend yourself from your foes’ magical attacks. You can add your Intelligence modifier to saving throws you make against spells and other magical effects that deal damage. Strategic Deflection Starting at 14th level, when a creature casts a spell that forces you to make a saving throw to avoid damage, you can use your reaction to attempt to redirect some of the spell’s energy to a new target. If you succeed on your saving throw against the spell, choose another creature you can see within the spell’s range or up to 30 feet away from you, whichever is closer, to make a saving throw against the spell, using your spell save DC. The chosen creature can be the original spellcaster. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effects of the spell as if you had cast the spell and it had been the original target or been within the area of the spell. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Master Warmage At 20th level, you reach the pinnacle of your warmage prowess. Whenever you cast a cantrip that deals 4 dice of damage to a target, it instead deals 5 dice of damage (excluding your cantrip bonus dice). If you cast a cantrip that makes 4 attacks, it instead makes 5 attacks. Warmages: Experts in being bad at magic. Warmage Tricks The following tricks are presented in alphabetical order. If a warmage trick has prerequisites, you must meet them to choose it. You can choose the trick at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. Bishop's Maneuver Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Bishops You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.When you do so, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn. Blasting Cantrip Once on each of your turns, when you deal force damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line. Blinding Light Prerequisite: light cantrip When you use the light cantrip to target an object you are holding, you can direct a flare at a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, which must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. After a creature has failed a saving throw against this trick, it has advantage on all saving throws against it for the next 24 hours. Castle Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Rooks As an action, you can choose a willing Small or Medium creature you can see within 120 feet of you. You both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this trick, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Chivalrous Presence Prerequisite: House of Knights You gain proficiency in the Insight and Persuasion skills, and you have advantage on ability checks you make to interact with nobility. Additionally, other creatures can always discern when you are telling the truth. Cloak of Feathers Prerequisite: House of Rooks While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. Commander's Steed Prerequisites: House of Kings You learn the find steed spell and can cast it at will without expending a spell slot. Your steed is more resilient than most; its hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your warmage level. Corrosive Cantrip Once on each of your turns, when you deal acid damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can cause the acid to erode the target’s defenses. The next time a creature makes an attack roll against the target before the start of your next turn, the target takes a penalty to its Armor Class equal to half your warmage level (up to a maximum of −5) for that attack. Directed Momentum Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Lancers Once on each of your turns, when you score a critical hit with a melee attack or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make an unarmed strike against a second target. If the target is within range of your Shock Trooper feature, you can lunge toward it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 force damage. Draining Cantrip Whenever you deal necrotic or poison damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can siphon some of its life force. You gain temporary hit points equal to half your warmage level, which last for 1 minute. Encryptogram Prerequisite: cryptogram cantrip Your knowledge of ciphers has improved your magically clandestine communications. When you cast the cryptogram cantrip, its limit is 20 characters, instead of 8, and only the specified recipient can read the message. Explosive Cantrip Once on each of your turns, when you deal fire damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can cause it to explode. Each creature within 5 feet of the target, except you and the target, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take half the fire damage dealt to the target. Extended Range Whenever you cast a warmage cantrip that has a range of 5 feet or greater, its range is doubled. Field Medic Prerequisite: House of Bishops You learn the spare the dying cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. Additionally, when you cast spare the dying on a creature that has 0 hit points, the target regains 1 hit point and gains temporary hit points equal to your warmage level, which last for 1 minute. Once a creature regains hit points from this trick, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest. Flexible Range Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls. Additionally, when you cast a warmage cantrip that requires a melee spell attack, its range increases to 10 feet. Fold Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Cards You have learned to graciously accept defeat using your Deck of Fate. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can play your entire hand to cast the shield spell without expending a spell slot. Once you use this trick, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Gamble Prerequisites: House of Cards or House of Dice, cheat cantrip You are always under the effects of the cheat cantrip. Additionally, when you miss with an attack roll, or you fail an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the d20 and must use the new roll. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Infinite Variation Prerequisite: prestidigitation cantrip You have become exceptionally skilled at using the prestidigitation cantrip to mimic other spells. When you cast prestidigitation , you can use it to emulate the effects of any other cantrip that doesn’t deal damage, even one that is not on the warmage spell list. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, otherwise the spell fails. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for a cantrip cast using this trick, and it counts as a warmage cantrip for you. Icy Cantrip Once on each of your turns, when you deal cold damage to a creature with a warmage cantrip, you can numb the target with a frigid blast. The first time the target makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn, subtract half your warmage level from the attack roll. Knight's Aegis Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Knights, force buckler cantrip When you cast the force buckler cantrip, you can concentrate on it for up to 1 minute. The spell doesn’t end early if you are hit by an attack. Leading Edge Tactics Prerequisites: House of Lancers You always have a plan when engaging the enemy. Attacks against you have disadvantage during the first round of combat. You can't use this feature when you are surprised. Lieutenant's Demand Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Kings You can cast the spell command at will without expending a spell slot. Mage Hand Knack Prerequisite: mage hand cantrip Your skill with the mage hand cantrip allows you to use it as an extension of yourself. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can use one of the following effects with the hand: Press. The hand pushes against a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. Choose a direction away from that creature. Every foot of movement in that direction while the hand is pressing against it costs the creature 1 extra foot of movement. The hand continues to push against the target until the spell ends or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand. Punch. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 force damage. Seize. The hand grabs a Small or smaller creature and attempts to grapple it. The creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC or be grappled by the hand. The hand continues to grapple the target until the target uses an action to break the grapple on its turn, the spell ends, or you use your bonus action to use a different effect with the hand. Minor Shadow Illusion Prerequisite: minor illusion cantrip When you create the image of an object in an unoccupied space using the minor illusion cantrip, you can fill it with fibers of shadowstuff, causing it to become partially real. No matter what form the semi-real object takes, it still must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. It has AC 10 and 5 hit points, and it weighs 5 pounds. You can only have one semi-real illusion at a time. While this semi-real object exists, the cantrip requires your concentration. The illusion can’t replicate a creature, but it can deal damage to a creature within its 5-foot cube. If the illusion is of an object that can deal damage, a creature that enters the object’s 5-foot cube or begins its turn there must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of a type appropriate to the illusion. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). This damage can’t trigger Warmage Edge or any warmage tricks. Mystical Armor You can cast the mage armor spell on yourself at will, without using a spell slot or spell components. Mystical Athlete Prerequisite: quickstep or springheel cantrip When you cast the quickstep cantrip, your speed increases by 20 feet instead of 10 feet. When you cast the springheel cantrip, your jumping distance increases by 20 feet instead of 10 feet. If you know both of these cantrips, you can cast both of them as part of the same bonus action. Mystical Weaponmaster Prerequisite: force weapon or magic daggers cantrip When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll with the force weapon or magic daggers cantrips, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Mystical Vision You can cast the detect magic spell at will without expending a spell slot. Phantom Hookshot Prerequisite: phantom grapnel cantrip You can cast the phantom grapnel cantrip as a bonus action. If you do so, its range is reduced to 15 feet. When you cast the spell as an action, creatures are pulled an extra 10 feet toward you by the spell. Rapid Fortification Prerequisite: mending cantrip You can cast the mending cantrip as an action or a bonus action. If you cast it as an action, you can use one of the following effects: You can restore a single nonmagical object, such as a door, cart, or window, to pristine condition if at least half of its parts are present. This object can be no larger than 10 cubic feet, or 1 cubic foot if it is exceptionally complex (such as a clock). You can create simple fortifications, such as sealing a door shut, adding wooden planks to a window, or building a short stone wall (no larger than 10 cubic feet). You must have the materials present to use this ability. Snake Eyes Prerequisites: 10th level, House of Dice If you roll a 1 or 2 on a Die of Fate, you keep the die instead of giving it to the GM. Severe Cantrip When a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against one of your warmage cantrips, it automatically fails the save and takes twice the number of damage dice dealt by the spell, as if you scored a critical hit. The additional damage only applies to the creature that rolled a 1. Signature Focus Prerequisite: 5th level When you finish a long rest, you can place a unique sigil on a simple or martial weapon, which becomes your signature focus until you use this ability again. This weapon becomes magical, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells. Your signature focus is bonded to you, and gains a number of special abilities: As a bonus action, you can call your signature focus to your hand, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as it. You can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to attack and damage rolls using your signature focus. Your signature focus gains a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1). When you deal damage to a creature with it or a cantrip cast through it, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to that creature. Your focus regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest. Silent Cantrip Once on each of your turns when you deal thunder damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can create a 15-foot-diameter sphere of magical silence (as per the silence spell), centered on yourself or the creature (your choice), which lasts until the start of your next turn. Split Fire Prerequisite: 5th level When you cast a warmage cantrip that requires a single spell attack roll, you can select multiple creatures and make a spell attack roll against each one. You can target a number of creatures equal to the number of damage dice the cantrip deals, and split your damage dice up amongst your targets, to a minimum of 1 die of damage per target. Each attack must target a different creature. For example, fire bolt deals 3d10 damage. You can choose to target three creatures and deal 1d10 damage to each creature, or you can target two creatures, dealing 1d10 damage to one creature and 2d10 damage to the other creature, or you can target one creature for 3d10 damage. Static Cantrip Whenever you deal lightning damage to a hostile creature with a warmage cantrip, you can sap part of the energy into a charge, which clings to your body until the start of your next turn. While charged, you can use your reaction when you take damage from a creature you can see within 5 feet of you to deal lightning damage equal to half your warmage level to the creature. Unerring Strike Prerequisites: 10th level, true strike cantrip When you cast the true strike cantrip, you can concentrate on it for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. You gain advantage on the first attack roll you make against the target on each of your turns while maintaining concentration on true strike. Warmage Houses Each warmage is defined by their chosen House, which teaches them valuable skills and offers a confederation of allies they will keep for the rest of their lives. Named for games of strategy and games of chance, each house emphasizes a unique approach to spellcasting and combat.

        "description": "Maintaining her focus, the ashenforged sees the impending ambush from the two gangers closing in on her. In a single fluid motion, she draws her blades and spins gracefully, cutting the two punks down before they could draw their next breath. A human mercenary readies his rifle as a hail of gunfire pelts into the conduit he’s leaned against. He points out the enemy’s location to his companions. Nodding in a silent countdown, his digital scope marks the target, signaling his squad to execute a coordinated attack. Blocking a laser barrage with her energy shield, the valna guard focuses energy into her pistol before firing a stream of electricity into a mecharoid. The huge machine stumbles from the electrical jolt. Seizing on the opportunity, the valna’s matokai companion charges forward, burying his axe deep into the robot’s steel frame. Durability and mastery of arms are the highlights of the warrior’s abilities. While anyone can shoot a gun or swing a blade, only warriors can effectively practice the basics of all forms of combat. Their versatility and extensive training make them a force to be reckoned with in any confrontation. Ability Scores Strength or Dexterity should be your primary ability score depending on your fighting style. In addition to these two, Constitution should also be your second or third highest ability score.

        "name": "Witch",
        "description": "Witches seek knowledge, power, and connection in their communion with nature. They cultivate their bond to these elemental and primal forces, becoming guardians at the gate, attendants of deep knowledge, and liaisons to a realm of immeasurable possibilities. Spirits of Nature Witches have a deep connection to nature, often stemming from years of studying the natural world and regular communion with nature spirits. Theirs can be a practice of utility, veneration, or exploitation. Some commune through a deity of magic or nature, but most prefer to commune directly, with wind on their face, dirt underfoot, and blood on their tongue. Nature spirits are everywhere and in myriad forms, from the fundamental forces of the elements to the primal spirits of living things. A witch communicates with all spirits, whether small and fleeting, emerging spontaneously only to quickly condense back into the ebb and flow of the natural world, or massive ancients, dozing in lost corners while the world moves around them. With patient and skilled determination, witches appeal to these diverse beings—by befriending, cajoling, or coercing them—calling them into focus and coaxing them into service to perform both mundane and otherworldly feats. Creating a Witch When making a witch, consider why your character has a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character sensed their connection to nature from a young age, growing up and playing within the nearby woods, or they became lost or orphaned as a child only to be found and raised by a kindly witch. Perhaps the spirits of nature won’t leave you alone, constantly asking for help, though no one else can see them, and you take on this role reluctantly to curb constant disturbance. Perhaps you actively shunned the mortal world because of the actions of others, favoring the embrace of the wild. Quick Build You can make a witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the cometborn background (see the Backgrounds section later in this chapter). Third, choose the druidcraft, guidance, produce flame and shillelagh cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells charm person and thunderwave.

Cantrips You know four cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list (see the Spell Lists chapter for the full list of witch spells). You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table. Spell Slots The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell thunderwave, and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast thunderwave using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. A spell you choose must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic comes from negotiating and working with spirits to manifest your intentions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier Ritual Casting You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells. Some witch implements can also function as a spellcasting focus, as described in the Spirit Binding feature. Spirit Binding At 2nd level, practice with your coven unlocks the secrets of binding a spirit’s power into an object called a witch’s implement. When you gain this feature, choose one witch’s implement from the options below. You know how to make this witch’s implement, and you can do so by performing a 1-hour spirit-binding ritual with the appropriate object at hand. This ritual can be performed during a short or long rest. If you lose an implement or it is destroyed, you can repeat this ritual to bind a new spirit to a suitable replacement vessel. If a previous implement of the same type still exists when you perform this ritual, the binding ends on that previous object. Due to the nature of the binding, implements you create are only usable by you and any bound spirits are released from your implements when you die. As you gain levels in the witch class, you learn how to create additional types of witch’s implement. Choose an additional type of witch’s implement from the options below at 5th level and again at 15th level. You can have witch’s implements of different types active at the same time—provided you have performed the necessary spirit-binding rituals for each. Brewer’s Cauldron You bind a spirit into a nonmagical cauldron, kettle, or other portable cooking container. When you first learn how to create this implement, your Hit Dice becomes 1d10 per witch level instead of 1d8—including for the level gained that unlocked this feature. Your hit point maximum also increases by 1 for each previous level you have in the witch class when you learn how to create this implement. For example, if you learn how to create this witch’s implement at 5th level, your Hit Dice becomes 1d10 for 5th level and every level in the witch class thereafter, and your hit point maximum increases by 4. Brewed Concordance. As part of a long rest, you can use your cauldron to prepare a brew that fortifies the soul. This brew can be consumed by a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Each creature that partakes of the brew gains 1d8 temporary hit points which last until the next time the creature finishes a long rest. Spellcasting Focus. You can use your brewer’s cauldron as a spellcasting focus. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature using this item as your spellcasting focus, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. Greater Binding Once you gain access to greater binding, your brewer’s cauldron gains the following additional features. Brewed Concordance. Each creature that partakes of your brew now gains 1d12 temporary hit points, instead of 1d8. Efficient Implement. Your brewer’s cauldron can take the place of one material component worth 500 gp or less in a spell you cast. Using the cauldron in place of a material component does not damage or destroy the cauldron—even if the required component would typically be consumed by casting. Alternatively, the cost of all material components required for spells you cast using the cauldron as your spellcasting focus are reduced by half. Nightflyer You bind a spirit into a nonmagical broom, staff, or a similarly sized branch. When you learn how to create this implement, you are infused with the irrepressible energy of the night. You have advantage on all ability checks or saving throws against being grappled or restrained. In addition, once per short or long rest, you can take an additional action on your turn which you must use to Dash, Disengage, or Dodge. Night’s Journey. While nightflyer is within 30 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to activate the spirit within the broom, staff, or branch. While the spirit is active, nightflyer is a magic object with a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover. Nightflyer can carry up to 1,000 pounds of weight. On your turn, you can mentally command the spirit to move nightflyer up to its movement speed (no action required by you). It can’t take other actions. As part of your movement, you can mount or dismount nightflyer while it is within 5 feet of you. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. While nightflyer is active, you can use a bonus action to deactivate it. You can keep nightflyer activated for up to 1 minute. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 6 seconds (1 round) from nightflyer’s total active time. If nightflyer is flying when you deactivate it or when the duration expires, it—and anything attached to it—descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until it lands. Nightflyer regains all expended flying capability when you finish a long rest. Greater Binding Once you gain access to greater binding, your nightflyer gains the following additional feature. Night’s Journey. Nightflyer can now be active for up to 4 hours. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 1 minute from nightflyer’s total active time. In addition, nightflyer’s flying speed increases to 40 feet. Soul Candle You bind a spirit into a candle, which can be mounted on a candlestick, in a lantern, as part of a candelabra, or similar. Only you can light or extinguish the soul candle, which you can do mentally as a bonus action. Though the light appears to be a flame, it doesn’t burn the candle, and it produces no heat. The lit soul candle extinguishes if you are more than 60 feet away from it. While the candle is lit, you can choose for it to shed dim light in a 5-foot radius, or you can choose for it to shed bright light in a 5- to 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The candle can shed light of whatever color you choose, and changing the radius, brightness, or color of light shed by the soul candle requires no action. Soul Fire. As an action while the soul candle is lit, you can force the candle to burn with a supernatural substance called soul fire, causing the candle to emit one of the following effects of your choice instead of bright or dim light. You can change the effect’s radius as if it were light shed by the candle, as detailed above. While soul fire is active, you can use a bonus action to change which effect the soul candle emits. Soul fire can be activated for up to 1 minute, ending early if you extinguish the soul candle. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 6 seconds (1 round) from the soul fire’s total active time. The soul candle regains all expended soul fire time when you finish a long rest. Dark Sight. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, in the candle’s radius. Heart Sight. You can see invisible creatures and objects within the candle’s radius as if they were visible. In addition, you are aware of any creatures within the candle’s radius. This effect reveals a creature’s presence but doesn’t allow you to automatically see the creature, such as making you aware of a creature on the other side of a door. Magic Sight. You can sense the presence of magic within the candle’s radius, and you see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, learning its school, if any. This effect otherwise works like the detect magic spell. Deep Sight. You can see through solid matter within the candle’s radius. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. This vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block this effect, as does a thin sheet of lead. Spellcasting Focus. You can use your soul candle as a spellcasting focus. The first time you cast a spell that requires a spell attack roll using this item as your spellcasting focus on your turn, you have advantage on the spell attack roll. Greater Binding Once you gain access to greater binding, your implement gains the following features. Soul Fire. Soul fire can now be active for up to 10 minutes. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 1 minute from the soul fire’s total active time. Spirit Book You bind a spirit into a book, scroll, or other object suitable for recording information. When you first learn how to create this implement, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the spirit book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the witch spell list, they are nonetheless witch spells for you. Book of Knowledge. Whenever you gain a new spell slot from gaining a level in this class, one spell of your choice from any class’s spell list appears in your spirit book in a cipher only you can read. While the spirit book is on your person, you can expend spell slots to cast these spells like any other spell you know. Each of these spells counts as a witch spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of witch spells you know. When you first learn how to create this implement, the book fills with one spell of your choice of each level of witch spell you can cast. For example, if you select this Spirit Binding at 5th level, the book gains one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, and one 3rd-level spell of your choice from any class’s spell list. Your spirit book can never contain more than one spell of each level you can cast, to a maximum of 9 spells at 17th level. Universal Language. While holding the book, the spirit contained within it can translate languages for you, allowing you to read any written language and understand any language you hear. Greater Binding Once you gain access to greater binding, your implement gains the following features. Knowledge Quest. As an action, you can unleash the spirit within your book to investigate a problem and return to you with solutions. For 1 minute, the spirit can answer up to three questions you ask of it. The answer to each question is a one-word, truthful answer, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the spirit doesn’t know the answer to the question). The spirit’s knowledge is limited to what is common knowledge in the region where you are asking the question. Therefore, the spirit can confirm the name of the local lord’s lead advisor but not that the advisor is secretly a doppelganger. Once you use the spirit book in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Universal Language. While holding the book, you can now speak and write in any language, in addition to being able to read any written language and understand any language you hear. Thundering Aegis You bind a spirit into a bell, gong, chime, or other percussion instrument. When you first learn how to create this implement, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Investigation, Perception, or Performance. If you have proficiency in all of these skills, choose one. You now double your proficiency bonus whenever you make an ability check using the chosen skill. Chime of Revealing. While holding the thundering aegis, you can use an action to begin ringing it, banging it, or otherwise causing sound to issue from it, creating an audible soundscape that can be heard up to 60 feet away. While you can hear the sound created by your thundering aegis, you perceive your surroundings within 30 feet of you as if you had blindsight—including being able to target creatures or objects within this radius with attacks and spells. On each of your subsequent turns, you must use a bonus action to continue ringing the bell, banging the gong, or similarly creating sound from the thundering aegis. Otherwise, this effect ends. Chime of Deviation. While holding the thundering aegis, you can use an action to create a note that holds certain types of creatures at bay. For 1 minute, whenever an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must succeed a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be unable to move any closer to you that turn. Once you use this feature of the thundering aegis, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Spellcasting Focus. You can use your thundering aegis as a spellcasting focus. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage using this item as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals double damage to objects and structures. Greater Binding Once you gain access to greater binding, your implement gains the following features. Chime of Revealing. While you can hear your chime of revealing, you now perceive your surroundings within 60 feet of you as if you had blindsight—including being able to target creatures or objects within this radius with spells. Spellcasting Focus. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage using this item as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals double damage to constructs, as well as to objects and structures. Hex At 3rd level, you can create a potent disruptive magical effect called a Hex. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use a reaction to hex the creature. The hexed creature gains one Hex die, a d4. The creature must roll the Hex die and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that triggered your reaction. Once the Hex die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Hex die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your Hex die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 10th level, and a d10 at 15th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Greater Binding When you reach 9th level, you learn to draw greater power from the spirits bound to your witch implements. One of the witch implements you know how to make gains the benefits of the Greater Binding detailed in the implement’s entry in the Spirit Binding feature. When you reach 13th level and again at 17th level, you learn to draw greater power from one additional witch implement you know, which gains the benefits of its Greater Binding. Spirit Shroud At 20th level, you can use an action to call nearby spirits to form a field around you and lend their energy to your spells. For 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious, you gain the following benefits: Each creature of your choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of you takes force damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Whenever you cast a witch spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead. Hostile creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your witch spells. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.",

        "description": "Three old crones stoop over a boiling cauldron filled with all manner of bizarre filth, churning and bubbling with noxious fumes. In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one cackles loudly at what she sees. A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure no one is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree’s bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavyset boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy’s eyes. A young elf intently mutters something under his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony. Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts. Cursed While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With grueling effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torment that plagues them. Pariahs and Outcasts Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them. In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer, to healer, to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches relocate frequently, never residing in one place for too long. Familiar Masters It is rare to find a witch without their constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch’s familiar is ubiquitous to common folk for good reason. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters. Creating a Witch Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches, or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch’s curse and think about how you relate to it. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart? What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel manipulating the power of this curse outwards into hexes and spells? Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic. Quick Build To build a witch quickly, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Then, choose the acid splash, chill touch, hocuspocus, and minor illusion cantrips, and the hideous laughter and thunderwave spells. Choose the Hideous witch’s curse, and the Evil Eye and Misfortune hexes. Lastly, choose any background that illustrates your life before being cursed.

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d8 per witch level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per witch level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, blowguns, shortswords, and whips Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, poisoner’s kit Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Nature, Persuasion, Religion, and Survival Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: (a) a whip and blowgun, (b) a light crossbow and 20 bolts, or (c) any simple weapon (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack Leather armor, any simple weapon, and a dagger Male and Female Witches Witches are commonly considered to be only female, but in reality, male and female witches exist in equal number. This misconception is due to the fact that male witches are often called “hexers,” or are incorrectly deemed warlocks by common folk. Spellcasting You have learned to mold and reshape the magic that curses you into spells. Cantrips You know four cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table. Spell Slots The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell bane and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bane using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Ritual Casting You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells. Witch’s Curse You are wracked by a terrible curse, which infects your body and soul. At 1st level, choose the form that this curse takes from the options below. Burned. Almost all of your body has been scorched by arcane flames, leaving you with striking black scars and embers of magic that burn under the skin. As a result, you have resistance to fire damage, and you know the produce flame cantrip, which doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known. Drowned. Water fills your lungs, and yet you do not die. You can breathe air and water. Additionally, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Feral. Through your curse, you have forgotten the manners and customs of civilized men and gone to live among beasts in the wild. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. Additionally, while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Hideous. Your appearance is ghastly to behold. You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. When you roll initiative, you can choose one Humanoid you can see to scare. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Hollow. Your soul has been divorced from your body, trapping you in a limbo between life and death. When you or your familiar reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you drain some of its life force, gaining temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your witch level (minimum of 1). Infested. You are constantly followed by vermin, like insects and rats, which crawl on your skin and swarm in your wake. As a result, you are immune to disease. Additionally, you can command these pests as your own. Starting at 2nd level, you can choose the form of a swarm of rats for your familiar. Starting at 7th level, you can choose a swarm of insects. Loveless. You are cursed to never find true love. Jaded and disaffected, not even magic can turn your heart; as a result, you are immune to being charmed. Possessed. Your soul is occupied by a foreign spirit that sometimes tries to wrest away your consciousness. However, while you sleep, the spirit whispers magical secrets to you. You learn an additional witch spell at a level for which you have spell slots at 1st level, and again at 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level. These spells don’t count against your number of spells known. Starving. No matter how much you eat, food turns to ash in your mouth. Your curse nourishes you, but only at the edge of starvation, and you are constantly wracked by pangs of hunger. You don’t need to eat or drink, but can still imbibe and benefit from potions. Additionally, you are immune to the poisoned condition. Visions. You are cursed to have terrible visions of the future, presaging the death of your friends, family, and yourself. Though many of these visions are cruel deceptions, they are sometimes grimly accurate. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls. Whispers. Unseen voices murmur in your ears at all times. As such, you can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. Hexes You can learn a number of powerful incantations, known as hexes, derived from the same insidious magic that cursed you. At 1st level, you gain two hexes of your choice. Your hex options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain additional hexes of your choice, as shown in the Hexes Known column of the Witch table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hexes you know and replace it with another hex. Unless otherwise stated, if a hex requires an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC. All hexes require either verbal or somatic components (your choice at the time of casting the hex). Unless otherwise noted, if a hex lasts for a duration, you concentrate on it as you would a spell. You lose your concentration on a hex if you cast another hex; however, you can concentrate on a hex and a spell at the same time, making only one Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both. Cackle At 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to cackle. Doing so extends the duration of a hex on which you are concentrating by 1 round. If the hex has one or more targets, a target must be within 60 feet of you for the hex’s duration to extend for it. Not all witches laugh maniacally when they cackle, but all cackles require a verbal component, as if casting a spell. These range from mundane curses and insults, to the murmuring of dead languages and speaking backwards. Familiar At 2nd level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual without expending material components. This spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. The spell is improved in the following ways: Your familiar takes its turn immediately before or after your turn each round (your choice). Once on each of your turns as an action or a bonus action, you can mentally command your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack. You can use the find familiar spell to deliver spells that have ranges other than touch through your familiar. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: death snail,* flying book,* homunculus, mock,* moon jelly,* pet rock,* pseudodragon, rag doll,* sprite, tin soldier,* winter wolf pup,* and yarn golem.* The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk can be found in Appendix B. Witch Familiar As a witch, familiars you summon are imbued with your insidious magic, granting them the following benefits: Your familiar can use your spell attack modifier for its attack rolls. Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, saving throws, and damage rolls. You add twice your witch level to your familiar’s hit point maximum. Witch’s Craft Your skill in magic has culminated in learning a craft, an innate variety of magic that exists apart from the schools of magic. When you reach 3rd level, choose one Witch’s Craft. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. If your craft grants you a hex at any level, it doesn’t count against your number of hexes known. Craft Spells Each craft is associated with a branch of arcana, represented by a number of spells that you learn. The levels of these spells are noted in the craft description. These spells count as witch spells for you but don’t count against your number of spells known. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Insidious Spell Starting at 5th level, when you cast a witch spell that affects a creature that is under the effect of your hex, that creature has disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell. This feature only applies to a hostile creature that is the sole target of your hex. Improved Familiar At 7th level, your familiar’s attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, you can choose the following forms for your familiar: brass dragon wyrmling (can’t use its breath weapon), fright,* grep,* imp, or quasit. The statistics for creatures marked with an asterisk can be found in Appendix B. Dying Curse Beginning at 9th level, when a creature reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn’t kill you outright, you can lay a nefarious curse upon it. The creature is cursed for up to 24 hours. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. If you regain consciousness or the creature is targeted by the remove curse spell, the curse ends at the end of the creature’s next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. Grand Hex By 11th level, you have perfected deeply malevolent forms of magic. You learn one grand hex, and you learn another at 13th, 15th, and 18th level. Grand hexes are detailed at the end of the class description. Hexmaster By 20th level, you have mastered your foul magic. Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your hexes and grand hexes. Hexes The hexes below are presented in alphabetical order. Abate As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn. Apathy As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, the target becomes indifferent toward one creature of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by the creature to which it is indifferent. When the hex ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise. Beckon Familiar You can cast the find familiar spell as an action without expending a spell slot or material components. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can’t do so again for 1 minute. You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex. Bleeding As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, each time this target takes damage, it loses an extra 1d4 hit points. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. Charm As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn. When the hex ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you. Dire Familiar As an action, you can bolster your familiar. For 1 minute, your familiar’s hit point maximum and current hit points are increased by an amount equal to twice your witch level, and it gains a bonus to its damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier. You can cast other hexes while this hex is in effect. Once you cast this hex, you can’t cast it again until your familiar is dismissed, or until its duration expires. You must have the Familiar feature to choose this hex. Disorient As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, whenever the target makes an attack roll before the end of your next turn, it must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll. Doomward As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself that you can see within 60 feet of you. If this creature is reduced to 0 hit points before the end of your next turn, but not killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. This hex then ends and can’t be used on the same creature again until you finish a short or long rest. Duplicity As an action, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself composed of shadowstuff to confuse your enemies. When a creature attacks you, roll any die. On an odd number, the attack strikes the duplicate and misses, regardless of its roll, and the hex ends. On an even number, the attack targets you as normal. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. Evil Eye As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Fortune As an action, choose one friendly creature other than yourself that you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature has advantage on saving throws until the end of your next turn. Go Unseen As an action, you and your familiar become invisible (as per the invisibility spell). The effect ends at the end of your next turn, or if you or your familiar attack or cast a spell. Once you cast this hex, you can’t cast it again for 1 minute. Hobble As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed is reduced to 10 feet until the end of your next turn. If the creature is flying, it falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic. Knowing As an action, you open your third eye and become intuitively aware of your surroundings. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks until the end of your next turn. Additionally, choose one of the following pieces of information. You learn that piece of information for each creature within 30 feet of you. If a creature can speak a language If a creature is at or below half of its hit point maximum What a creature’s lowest ability score is You can only learn one of these things about a creature, even if you cast this hex more than once. Mire As an action, you can transform the ground in a 30-foot radius centered on the point where you cast this hex into murky swamp, which is difficult terrain. You and your familiar are immune to this hex. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. Misfortune As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, whenever this creature rolls a 20 on a d20 roll, the roll instead becomes a 1. Obfuscate As an action, you create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on yourself. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Peacebond As an action, you can lock weapons to their owners. The weapons and ammunition of each creature within 30 feet of you become locked in their sheaths, quivers, or holsters until the end of your next turn. During this time, a creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing its weapon on a success. Pox As an action, choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of your next turn. Ruin As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s Armor Class decreases by 3, to a minimum of 10, until the end of your next turn. Scurry As an action, a nonmagical object you choose within 30 feet of you sprouts legs and runs away. You can’t target an object that weighs more than 10 pounds, nor can you target one that is being worn as clothing or armor; however, you can target certain objects that are being carried, as long as they aren’t affixed entirely around a creature’s body or being held in a hand. For example, you can’t target a creature’s helmet or a sword it is wielding, but you can target a drawstring pouch it is wearing or a dagger that is sheathed at its side. The object animates, wriggles free of its owner (if it has one), sprouts two legs, and moves 20 feet in a direction you choose. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose which direction the object moves. The object has an AC of 10, if its AC wasn’t already higher, and remains animated until the end of your next turn, or until it is picked up. Shriek As a bonus action, you can release a thunderous, blood-curdling screech. Each Large or smaller creature you choose within 5 feet of you is pushed 5 feet away from you. Slumber As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious until it takes damage, or until the end of your next turn. Undead, creatures that are immune to being charmed, and creatures whose current hit points are greater than five times your witch level are immune to this effect. Slur As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target can’t speak coherently until the end of your next turn. If the creature attempts to cast a spell that requires a verbal component, it must roll a d20. On an odd roll, the casting fails. Tremors As an action, you can create a miniature earthquake. Each creature on the ground within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Ward As an action, choose one creature you can see other than yourself within 60 feet of you. Each time the creature takes damage before the end of your next turn, the damage it takes is reduced by 3. Hexes and Magic A witch casts their terrible hexes as an extension of their curse. As their curses are magical in nature, their hexes are considered 0th-level spells for the purposes of feature and spells, such as counterspell or dispel magic, that interact with magic. Furthermore, all hexes cease while in the area of an antimagic field or similar effect. Grand Hexes The grand hexes below are presented in alphabetical order. Unless otherwise stated, if a grand hex requires an attack roll or saving throw, it uses your spell attack modifier and spell save DC. Grand hex features don’t count as hexes. Cauldron You can brew potions in a bubbling cauldron using raw components scavenged from nature. To this end, you have a pool of alchemy points equal to half your witch level, rounded down. You regain all expended alchemy points when you finish a long rest. You can spend 10 minutes and expend any number of alchemy points to brew potions. These potions retain potency for 24 hours, after which they become inert. If a potion calls requires a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. The potions available for you to brew are given on the Cauldron Potions table below. Cauldron Potions Potion Alchemy Points Potion of Animal Friendship 1 Potion of Growth 1 Potion of Healing 1 Potion of Water Breathing 1 Oil of Slipperiness 2 Philter of Love 2 Potion of Greater Healing 2 Potion of Heroism 2 Potion of Resistance 2 Potion of Clairvoyance 3 Potion of Diminution 3 Potion of Gaseous Form 3 Coven You can induct others into your insidious coven. By performing a special ritual over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can intermingle your cursed magic with a willing creature that has the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature. This creature enters into your coven. You can have up to two creatures other than yourself in your coven at a time. While two or more members of your coven are within 30 feet of one another, they gain the ability to cast additional spells, as shown on the Coven Spellcasting table. Additionally, members of your coven gain access to a shared pool of five spell slots—one of each level, from 1st to 5th level—which they can use to cast spells as normal. Expended spell slots are regained when all members of the coven finish a long rest. Coven members use their own spellcasting ability to determine spell attack modifiers and spell save DCs. A coven member can’t cast spells of a level for which it doesn’t personally have spell slots, even if using a higher level shared spell slot. A shared spell slot can be used, for instance, to cast a lower level spell at higher levels, but it can’t be used to cast a spell normally too high-level for a spellcaster. Coven Spellcasting Spell Level Spells 1st bane, hideous laughter 2nd invisibility, ray of enfeeblement 3rd bestow curse, counterspell 4th banishment, polymorph 5th contagion, scrying Dual Hex When you cast a hex that targets one creature other than yourself, you can target two creatures instead. While both targets are under the effect of your hex, you gain the benefits of your Insidious Spell feature against each of them. Forceful Personality Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your maximum for this score increases to 22. Hybrid As a bonus action, if your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you can meld with it, transforming into a magical hybrid. For the next minute, you gain the following benefits: You gain temporary hit points equal to your familiar’s hit points. Your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, as long as you aren’t wielding a shield. You can use this calculation to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. You gain two natural melee weapons, corresponding to your familiar’s attacks. You are proficient with these weapons, and use Charisma for their attack and damage rolls. On a hit, these natural weapons deal 1d10 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice). You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. You can use any action or movement your familiar possesses. This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it on your turn (no action required). When it ends, your familiar is dismissed, and you can’t summon it again until you finish a short or long rest. Poison Apple As an action, you can produce a magical apple out of thin air. This apple can possess whatever appearance you wish, be that a ruby red coloration, a golden skin, or the appearance of crystal. You can use your action to eat the apple, granting you the following benefits: You regain hit points equal to twice your witch level + your Charisma modifier. You regain an expended spell slot of 5th level or lower. You can end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, deafened, paralyzed (if the apple is fed to you as an action), or poisoned. However, the apple is suffused with your insidious magic. If a creature other than you eats the apple, it doesn’t gain any benefits and instead must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for up to 24 hours. For each hour the creature is poisoned, it loses 4d8 hit points. This loss can’t be reduced or avoided. If this reduction causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and falls into a catatonic sleep, remaining unconscious for up to 7 days. A remove curse spell or similar magic can awaken the creature early. The apple shrivels and becomes nonmagical if it isn’t eaten within 24 hours. Once you produce a magical apple, you can’t produce another one until you finish a long rest. Possession As an action, your body becomes immaterial, and your spirit dives into a Large or smaller creature you can see within 10 feet of you in an attempt to possess it. This target must make a Charisma saving throw. A creature with a challenge rating greater than your witch level automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, you disappear along with your equipment and the target becomes incapacitated and possessed; you gain control of its body but don’t deprive the target of its awareness. While possessing the creature, you can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. You maintain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma and your alignment, but otherwise use the creature’s statistics. You don’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. For the purposes of spells and effects which can end possession, such as the spell dispel evil and good , you are treated as an Undead spirit and can be banished from the target, returning to your own body, which rematerializes within 5 feet of the target. This possession lasts for 1 hour, or until the body drops to 0 hit points or you are forced out by a spell or other magical effect that ends possession. Once you use this grand hex, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. War Hex When you cast a hex that targets a single creature, you can use your bonus action to cast a cantrip targeting the same creature. Witch's Broom You can use your action to enchant a nonmagical object—such as a broom, cauldron, or rug—to fly for you. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet while holding this item, as long as you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor, or wielding a shield. This object remains enchanted until you use this grand hex to enchant a different object. Witch's Hut You can perform a 24-hour ritual to enchant a structure that can fit within a 15-foot cube, animating it as a Huge object, as per the animate objects spell. The structure rises up on a pair of magical legs and follows your commands. The entrance to the structure is linked to an extradimensional dwelling, as per the magnificent mansion spell. You can command the structure from inside this dwelling. If the structure is destroyed, the extradimensional dwelling is unharmed, but any creatures inside it are expelled into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance. As an action, you can teleport the structure to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. Once you teleport the structure, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can repeat the 24-hour ritual to end the enchantment on your previous structure and enchant a new one. I store the Spire’s chicken legs on the sublevels. Witch’s Crafts A witch’s craft is distinct from a school of magic. Whereas magical schools seek to categorize spells, crafts are defined by the use of magic, and seek to capture the essence of spells. There are dozens of varieties, from those practiced by covens in secret, to those plied in marketplace potion shops. Each craft has a number of Craft Spells. New spells are marked with an asterisk. Witch's Crafts Name Description Black Magic Practices the necromantic arts and wields dark spells of suffering Blood Magic Lays terrible curses and draws power from blood sacrifices Green Magic Practices magic associated with plants, animals, and the natural world Purple Magic Wields illusions and enchantments in equal measure Red Magic A destructive spellcaster wielding magic that ruins and burns Steel Magic Melds swordsmanship with wicked hexes Tea Magic A peaceful witch that practices tea ceremonies and divination Technicolor Magic Makes friends with just about everyone they meet White Magic A natural healer and practitioner of restorative magic",

        "description": "Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells⁠ of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Scholars of the Arcane Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study. Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells⁠ as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic. The Lure of Knowledge Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library⁠ or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age. Creating a Wizard How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger. Quick Build You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the light , mage hand , and ray of frost cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning hands , charm person , mage armor , magic missile , shield, and sleep .

Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st Proficiencies Armor: None Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows Tools: None Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background: ( a ) a quarterstaff or ( b ) a dagger ( a ) a component pouch or ( b ) an arcane focus ( a ) a scholar’s pack or ( b ) an explorer’s pack A spellbook Spellcasting As a student of arcane magic⁠, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 4 for the general rules of spellcasting. Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook⁠ is the repository of the wizard spells⁠ you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells⁠ from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells⁠ requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells⁠ through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one, as explained in chapter 4. Your Spellbook⁠ The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells⁠ during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library⁠. Copying a Spell into the Book⁠. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook⁠ using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book⁠. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook⁠. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook⁠, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook⁠. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells⁠ to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library⁠, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook⁠. Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook”). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic: Evocation, or Transmutation, both of which are detailed at the end of the class description. See the Player's Handbook for more information on arcane traditions. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Arcane Traditions The most ancient arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter 4. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students. School of Evocation School of Transmutation",

Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list . You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see “ Your Spellbook ”). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Spell Mastery At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Signature Spells When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. Arcane Traditions The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic . Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. School of Evocation You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. Evocation Savant Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. Sculpt Spells Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. Potent Cantrip Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. Empowered Evocation Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. Overchannel Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. Your Spellbook The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book : When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Replacing the Book : You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance : Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-­edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.",

        "description": "Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers. Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond. Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left. Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells⁠ of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells⁠ change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds. Scholars of the Arcane Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study. Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells⁠ as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic. The Lure of Knowledge Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library⁠ or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age. Creating a Wizard Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger. Quick Build You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. If you plan to join the School of Enchantment, make Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the mage hand , light , and ray of frost cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning hands , charm person , feather fall , mage armor , magic missile , and sleep .

See \"Casting a Spell\" for the general rules of spellcasting and the wizard spell list under \"Wizard Spells by Level\". Cantrips At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. Spellbook At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook⁠ is the repository of the wizard spells⁠ you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. Preparing and Casting Spells The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells⁠ from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile , you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells⁠ requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells⁠ through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Your Spellbook⁠ The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells⁠ during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library⁠.

Ritual Casting You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook”). Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. Arcane Tradition When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Ability Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Spell Mastery At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells⁠ at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells⁠ of the same levels. Signature Spells⁠ When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells⁠ in your spellbook⁠ as your signature spells⁠. You always have these spells⁠ prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells⁠ you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells , which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light , Mage Hand , and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice. When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table. Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify . You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine. The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic , Feather Fall , Mage Armor , Magic Missile , Sleep , and Thunderwave are recommended. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly. Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest . Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard , your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook. Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells . Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells . Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll , for example, and then copy it into your spellbook. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell , you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook. Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook. Level 1: Ritual Adept You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way. Level 1: Arcane Recovery You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest , you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard , you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest . Level 2: Scholar While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana , History , Investigation , Medicine , Nature , or Religion . You have Expertise in the chosen skill. Level 3: Wizard Subclass You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer , Diviner , Evoker , and Illusionist subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Memorize Spell Whenever you finish a Short Rest , you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book. Level 18: Spell Mastery You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action . You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot. Whenever you finish a Long Rest , you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 ) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended. Level 20: Signature Spells Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest . To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds. Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse. The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description. Cantrips. You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. Light , Mage Hand , and Ray of Frost are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice. When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table. Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify . You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine. The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic , Feather Fall , Mage Armor , Magic Missile , Sleep , and Thunderwave are recommended. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly. Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest. Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you. Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook. Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells. Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll , for example, and then copy it into your spellbook. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook. Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook. Level 1: Ritual Adept You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way. Level 1: Arcane Recovery You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest. Level 2: Scholar While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in the chosen skill. Level 3: Wizard Subclass You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Abjurer, Diviner, Evoker, and Illusionist subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower. Level 4: Ability Score Improvement You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16. Level 5: Memorize Spell Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book. Level 18: Spell Mastery You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book. Level 19: Epic Boon You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended. Level 20: Signature Spells Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot. Wizard Spell List This section presents the Wizard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.
